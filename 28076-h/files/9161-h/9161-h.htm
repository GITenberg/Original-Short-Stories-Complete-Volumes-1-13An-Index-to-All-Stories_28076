      Mme. de Sallus <i>in her drawing-room, seated in a corner by the

      Don&rsquo;t be afraid; no one saw me.

      Oh, they are in the outer hall.

    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      How is that? No one announced you

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL
    </p>
    <p>
      No, they simply opened the door for me.

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, they will doubtless think that <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t count.

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS

      But I will not permit it. I must have you announced in future. It does not

    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL [<i>laughs</i>]

      Perhaps they will even go so far as to announce your husband&mdash;

    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS

      Jacques, this jesting is out of place.

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgive me. [<i>Sits</i>.] Are you waiting for anybody?

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes&mdash;probably. You know that I always receive when I am at home.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL
    </p>
    <p>
      I know that I always have the pleasure of seeing you for about five
      minutes&mdash;just enough time to ask you how you feel, and then some one
      else comes in&mdash;some one in love with you, of course,&mdash;who
      impatiently awaits my departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS [<i>smiles</i>]

      Well, what can I do? I am not your wife, so how can it be otherwise?

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL
    </p>
    <p>
      I would snatch you away for five or six months, far from this horrible
      town, and keep you all to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      You would soon have enough of me.

    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS [<i>bridles</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      And why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL
    </p>
    <p>
      Because I covet you as the starving covet the food they see behind the
      glassy barriers of a restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, Jacques!

    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL
    </p>
    <p>
      I tell you it is true! A woman of the world belongs to the world; that is
      to say, to everyone except the man to whom she gives herself. He can see
      her with open doors for a quarter of an hour every three days&mdash;not
      oftener, because of servants. In exceptional cases, with a thousand
      precautions, with a thousand fears, with a thousand subterfuges, she
      visits him once or twice a month, perhaps, in a furnished room. Then she
      has just a quarter of an hour to give him, because she has just left
      Madame X in order to visit Madame Z, where she has told her coachman to
      take her. If he complains, she will not come again, because it is
      impossible for her to get rid of her coachman. So, you see, the coachman,
      and the footman, and Madame Z, and Madame X, and all the others, who visit
      her house as they would a museum,&mdash;a museum that never closes,&mdash;all
      the he&rsquo;s and all the she&rsquo;s who eat up her leisure minute by minute and
      second by second, to whom she owes her time as an employee owes his time
      to the State, simply because she belongs to the world&mdash;all these
      persons are like the transparent and impassable glass: they keep you from
      my love.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>dryly</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      You seem upset to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no, but I hunger to be alone with you. You are mine, are you not? Or,
      I should say, I am yours. Isn&rsquo;t it true? I spend my life in looking for
      opportunities to meet you. Our love is made up of chance meetings, of
      casual bows, of stolen looks, of slight touches&mdash;nothing more. We
      meet on the avenue in the morning&mdash;a bow; we meet at your house, or
      at that of some other acquaintance&mdash;twenty words; we dine somewhere
      at the same table, too far from each other to talk, and I dare not even
      look at you because of hostile eyes. Is that love? We are simply
      acquaintances.

      Oh, you have played a queer little game! From the day I first met you I
      felt that you were coquetting with me, coquetting mysteriously, obscurely,
      coquetting as only you can without showing it to others. Little by little
      you conquered me with looks, with smiles, with pressures of the hand,
      without compromising yourself, without pledging yourself, without
      revealing yourself. You have been horribly upright&mdash;and seductive. I
      have loved you with all my soul, yes, sincerely and loyally, and to-day I
      do not know what feeling you have in the depths of your heart, what
      thoughts you have hidden in your brain; in fact, I know-I know nothing. I
      look at you, and I see a woman who seems to have chosen me, and seems also
      to have forgotten that she <i>has</i> chosen me. Does she love me, or is
      she tired of me? Has she simply made an experiment&mdash;taken a lover in
      order to see, to know, to taste,&mdash;without desire, hunger, or thirst?
      There are days when I ask myself if among those who love you and who tell
      you so unceasingly there is not one whom you really love.

    </p>
    <p>
      Well, you know my position, although I have never told you all my past
      life. It is all very simple and very brief. At the age of nineteen I
      married the Count de Sallus, who fell in love with me after he had seen me
      at the Opéra-Comique. He already knew my father&rsquo;s lawyer. He was very nice
      to me in those early days; yes, very nice, and I really believed he loved
      me. As for myself, I was very circumspect in my behavior toward him, very
      circumspect indeed, so that he could never cast a shadow of reproach on my
      name.

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL

    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL
    </p>

      Then you did love him?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes and no. If I loved him, it was the love of a little fool; but I
      certainly never told him, for positively I do not know how to show love.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL
    </p>
    <p>
      I can vouch for that!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it is possible that I cared for him sometimes, idiotically, like a
      timid, restless, trembling, awkward, little girl, always in fear of that
      disturbing thing&mdash;the love of a man&mdash;that disturbing thing that
      is sometimes so sweet! As for him,&mdash;you know him. He was a
      sweetheart, a society sweetheart, who are always the worst of all. Such
      men really have a lasting affection only for those girls who are fitting
      companions for clubmen&mdash;girls who have a habit of telling doubtful
      stories and bestowing depraved kisses. It seems to me that to attract and
      to hold such people, the nude and obscene are necessary both in word and
      in body&mdash;unless&mdash;unless&mdash;it is true that men are incapable
      of loving any woman for a length of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I soon became aware that he was indifferent to me, for he used to
      kiss me as a matter of course and look at me without realizing my
      presence; and in his manners, in his actions, in his conversation, he
      showed that I attracted him no longer. As soon as he came into the room he
      would throw himself upon the sofa, take up the newspaper, read it, shrug
      his shoulders, and when he read anything he did not agree with, he would
      express his annoyance audibly. Finally, one day, he yawned and stretched
      his arms in my face. On that day I understood that I was no longer loved.
      Keenly mortified I certainly was. But it hurt me so much that I did not
      realize it was necessary to coquet with him in order to retain his
      affection. I soon learned that he had a mistress, a woman of the world.
      Since then we have lived separate lives&mdash;after a very stormy
      explanation.

    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes and no. I find it difficult to express myself. To avoid my suspicions
      he found himself obliged, doubtless, to dissimulate from time to time,
      although rarely, and to feign a certain affection for his legitimate wife,
      the woman who had the right to his affection. I told him that he might
      abstain in future from such a mockery of love.

      No, he appeared very much surprised at first. Then I formulated a nice
      little speech and learned it by heart, in which I asked him to carry such
      intermittent fancies elsewhere. He understood me, saluted me very

      That is of small importance. What is of importance, though, is that he has
      had innumerable mistresses whom he entertains, whom he supports, whom he
      takes out. It is this that has irritated and humiliated me&mdash;in fact,
      cut me to the quick. But then I took heart of grace, and too late, two
      years too late, I took a lover&mdash;you!

      You dare to say of love that it is not proper? If you loved me, it might
      be divine, but a loving woman would abhor a phrase which should contain
      such an idea. What! True love not proper?

      A man falls in love with his wife before he marries her, but after
      marriage he never commits the same mistake.

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL
    </p>
    <p>
      It is absolutely impossible that he could have lived with you&mdash;even
      in his curt, cavalier fashion&mdash;without loving you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS [<i>indifferently</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      It is of little importance. He has either loved me in the past, or is now
      beginning to love me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly, I do not understand you. Tell me all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      But I have nothing to tell. He declares his love for me, takes me in his
      arms, and threatens me with his conjugal rights. This upsets me, torments
      me, and annoys me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline you torture me.

    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS [<i>quickly</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      And what about me? Do you think that I do not suffer? I know that I am not
      exactly a faithful woman since I received your addresses, but I have, and
      shall retain, a single heart. It is either you <i>or</i> he. It will never
      be you <i>and</i> he. For me that would be infamy&mdash;the greatest
      infamy of a guilty woman, the sharing of her heart&mdash;a thing that
      debases her. One may fall, perhaps, because there are ditches along the
      wayside and it is not always easy to follow the right path. But if one
      falls, that is no reason to throw oneself in the abyss.

    <p>

      I will explain the mystery. The fact of the matter is this, your husband

      I mean that your husband is unattached just now, and seeks to spend his

    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;and no. He is in love with you&mdash;and also with
      another. Tell me, his temper is usually bad, isn&rsquo;t it?

    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, then, here is a man in love with you who shows his wonderful return
      of tenderness by moods that are simply unsupportable&mdash;for they are
      unsupportable, aren&rsquo;t they?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL
    </p>
    <p>
      If he wooed you with tenderness you would not feel fear. You would say to
      yourself, &ldquo;My turn has come at last,&rdquo; and then he would inspire you with a
      little pity for him, for a woman has always a sneaking sort of compassion
      for the man who loves her, even though that man be her husband.

    <p>

      Yes, a capricious, saucy, cunning, venal little woman. A woman not at all

      The Santelli resists him and repulses him; then, burdened with a heart
      full of longing that has no outlet, he deigns to offer you a portion.

      My dear, you are dreaming. If he were in love with the Santelli, he would
      not tell me that he loves me. If he were so entirely preoccupied with this
      creature, he would not woo me. If he coveted her, he would not desire me
      at the same time.

    <p>
      How little you understand certain kinds of men! Men like your husband,
      once inoculated with the poison of love,&mdash;which in them is nothing
      but brutal desire,&mdash;men like him, I say, when a woman they desire
      escapes or resists them, become raging beasts. They behave like madmen,
      like men possessed, with arms outstretched and lips wide open. They must
      love some one, no matter whom just as a mad dog with open jaws bites
      anything and everybody. The Santelli has unchained this raging brute, and
      you find yourself face to face with his dripping jaws. Take care! You call
      that love! It is nothing but animal passion.

    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I think you are. Formerly my husband neglected and abandoned me,
      doubtless finding me very insipid; but now he finds me much improved, and
      has returned to me. It is very easy to understand, and moreover, it is the
      worse for him, for he <i>must</i> believe that I have been a <i>faithful</i>
      wife to him all my life.

      Does a girl cease to be a faithful wife, if, when deserted by the man who
      has assumed charge of her existence, and her happiness, and her love, and
      her ideals, she refuses to resign herself&mdash;young, beautiful, and full
      of hope&mdash;to eternal isolation and everlasting solitude?

      I think I have already told you that there are certain things which it is
      <i>not</i> necessary to discuss, and this is one of them. [<i>The front
      door bell sounds twice.</i>] Here is my husband. Please be silent. He is

      I think I shall go. I am not in love with your husband any more, for many
      reasons, and it is difficult for me to be polite to him when I despise
      him, and when I know that he ought to despise me, and would despise me
      when I shake hands with him, did he know all.

      Just what I say. When I saw the carriage waiting at the door, I asked the

      he been here long?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;He has been here since ten,&rdquo; said the
      footman. Admitting that the man might have been mistaken, we will say, in
      the matter of a quarter of an hour, that would make an hour and a quarter,
      at the least.

    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS

    <p>
      Thank you. You simply have not the right. However, since you adopt this
      attitude, let us settle this question once for all, for I loathe
      misunderstandings. It seems to me that you have an exceedingly short
      memory. Let me come to your aid. Be frank with me. Through some
      occurrence, the nature of which I do not know, your attitude is different
      today from that of the past two years. Cast your memory over the past, to
      the time when you began to neglect me in a manner that was plain to all. I
      became very uneasy. Then I knew&mdash;I was told, and I saw&mdash;that you
      were in love with Madame de Servières. I told you how hurt I was, how
      grieved I was. What did you reply? Just what every man replies when he no
      longer loves the woman who reproaches him. You shrugged your shoulders,
      smiled impatiently, told me I was mad, and then expounded to me&mdash;I
      must admit, in a most skillful manner&mdash;those grand principles of
      freedom in love that are adopted by every husband who deceives his wife
      and thinks she will not deceive him. You gave me to understand that
      marriage is not a bond, but simply an association of mutual interests, a
      social rather than a moral alliance; that it does not demand friendship or
      affection between married couples, provided there be no scandal. You did
      not absolutely confess the existence of your mistresses, but you pleaded
      extenuating circumstances. You were very sarcastic upon the subject of
      those poor, silly women who object to their husbands being gallant toward
      other women, since, according to you, such gallantry is one of the laws of
      the polished society to which you belong. You laughed at the foolish man
      who does not dare to pay compliments to a woman in the presence of his own
      wife, and ridiculed the gloomy look of a wife whose eyes follow her
      husband into every corner, imagining that because the poor man disappears
      into an adjoining room he is at the feet of a rival. All this was very
      airy, funny, and disagreeable, wrapped up in compliments and spiced with
      cynicism&mdash;sweet and bitter at the same time, and calculated to banish
      from the heart all love for a smooth, false, and well-bred man who could
      talk in such a manner. I understood, I wept, I suffered, and then I shut
      my door upon you. You made no objection; you judged me better than you
      thought; and since then we have lived completely separate lives. Such has
      been the case for the past two years, two long years and more, which
      certainly have not seemed more than six months to you. We go into society
      as usual, we return from society as usual, and we each enter our own
      temple of life. The situation was established by you in consequence of
      your first infidelity, an infidelity which has been followed by many
      others. I have said nothing; I have resigned myself to the situation; and
      I have banished you from my heart. Now that I have finished, what do you
      wish?

    </p>
    <p>
      M. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear, I am not asking for anything. I do not even wish to answer the
      very aggressive speech you have done me the honor to make. I only wish to
      give you advice&mdash;the advice of a friend&mdash;upon a situation that
      may possibly endanger your reputation. You are beautiful, always in the
      public eye, and much envied. Scandal could have easy birth.

    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS

      Pardon me. If we are to speak of scandal, I must have leave to balance my
      account with you.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      M. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Come, do not let us joke over this thing. I speak to you as a friend&mdash;seriously,
      as a friend. As to what you have said about me, it is all extremely
      exaggerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Not at all. You have never tried to conceal, in fact, you have actually
      proclaimed to all the world your infidelities&mdash;a fact which gives me
      the right to go and do likewise, and, my friend, believe what I say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      M. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      One moment&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me finish. According to you, I am beautiful, I am young, and yet
      condemned by my husband to live, and watch him live, as if I were a widow.
      Look at me [<i>rises</i>], is it just to consign me to play the rôle of an
      abandoned Ariadne, while my husband runs from this woman to that woman,
      and this girl to that girl? [<i>Grows excited</i>.] A faithful wife! I cry
      you mercy! Is a faithful wife compelled to sacrifice all her life, all her
      happiness, all her affections, everything, in fact, every privilege, every
      expectation, every claim, which is hers by birth and for which she has
      been born? Look at me! Am I made for a nunnery? The fact that I married
      you should answer that question. And yet, you, <i>you</i>, who took me
      from my father&rsquo;s house, neglect me to run after others. And what others? I
      am not in their circle, neither am I one of those who would share your
      life with others. So much the worse for you&mdash;for I am free, and you
      have no right to give me advice since I <i>am</i> free.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      M. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear girl, be calm. You misunderstand me completely. I have never
      suspected you. Indeed, I have the most profound esteem and friendship for
      you&mdash;a loving friendship which grows greater every day. I have no
      wish to comment upon that past with which you reproach me so cruelly.
      Perhaps I am a little too&mdash;too&mdash;what shall I say?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! Say that you belong to the period of the Regency. I know that method
      of excusing all male weaknesses and follies. Oh! yes; that eighteenth
      century, that <i>dainty</i> century, so full of <i>elegance</i>, so full
      of delicious <i>fantasies</i> and adorable <i>whims</i>! Alas! my dear,
      that is ancient history.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      M. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no, you misunderstand me again. Believe me, I am and have been above
      everything too&mdash;too&mdash;much of a Parisian, too much accustomed to
      turning night into day, for the sedate life of marriage. I have been too
      much accustomed to go behind the scenes of theaters, to various clubs, to
      a thousand other forms of dissipation; and you know a man cannot change
      all at once,&mdash;it takes time. Marriage seeks to change us all too
      suddenly. It ought to give us time to get accustomed to it, little by
      little. You would practically take away from me the joy of life were I to
      behave as you seem to desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      I am so grateful; and now, perhaps, you wish to offer me a new proof&mdash;a
      new proof&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      M. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, as you please. Really, when a man who has lived as I have marries, he
      can hardly help looking upon his wife as a new mistress&mdash;I mean to
      say a faithful mistress&mdash;and it is only when it is too late that he
      understands more clearly,&mdash;comes to his senses and repents.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, my friend, it <i>is</i> too late. As I have already told you, I mean
      to have my innings. I have taken nearly three years to think it over. You
      may think that is long, but I need some amusement as well as you. The fact
      that I have taken nearly three years to think it over is a compliment to
      you, but you fail to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      M. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline, this jesting is altogether out of place.

    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! no, because I am compelled to think that every one of your mistresses
      was far more attractive than I, since you have preferred them to me.

      Let me illustrate. When you are young you are always hungry, and when a
      youth is hungry he often eats things that he would not eat at another
      time. Well, I am the dish,&mdash;the dish that you have neglected in your
      days of plenty, the dish to which you return in the days of scarcity&mdash;[<i>slowly</i>]

    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, a truce to your swearing! I know that you have just broken with one of
      your mistresses; you need another and you cannot find one, so you come to
      me. For nearly three years you have forgotten all about me, so that now
      you find I am somewhat of a novelty. It is not your wife you are seeking
      now, but a woman with whom you have formerly had a rupture, and with whom
      you now desire to make up. To speak the truth you are simply playing the
      game of a libertine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      M. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not ask you whether you be my wife or not my wife. You are the woman
      I love, the woman who possesses my heart. You are the woman of whom I
      dream, whose image follows me everywhere, whom I continually desire. It
      happens that you are my wife. So much the worse, or so much the better.
      What matters it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly, it is a distinguished part that you offer me. After Mademoiselle
      Zozo, after Mademoiselle Lilie, Mademoiselle Tata, you have the audacity
      to offer to your wife&mdash;to Madame de Sallus&mdash;the place left
      vacant, asking her to become her husband&rsquo;s mistress for a short space of
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      M. DE SALLUS

    <p>
      No; now, and&mdash;forever.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Pardon me. You ask that I should re-become your wife forever? That is out
      of the question; I have already ceased to entertain the idea. The reason
      may be obscure, but nevertheless it is real; and after all, the idea of
      making me your <i>legitimate</i> mistress seems to be far more
      entertaining to you than assuming the rôle of a <i>faithful</i> husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. DE SALLUS [<i>laughs</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, why should not the wife become the husband&rsquo;s mistress? You are right
      in what you say; you are absolutely free and I own my faults. Yet, I am in
      love with you-for the second time, if you will-and I say to you, here and
      now, Madeline, since you confess that your heart is empty, have pity upon
      me, for I tell you that I love you.

      Well, tell me, now, truly, how much has the one you liked best among all

    </p>

    <p>
      Listen to me. I repeat the question. How much has the most charming of
      your numerous mistresses cost you in the space of three months&mdash;not
      only in money, but in gifts of jewelry, in dainty little suppers, in
      ceremonious dinners, in theater boxes,&mdash;in everything?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      M. DE SALLUS

      How can I tell?

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      You should be able to. Come, let us make an estimate. Did you give her a
      round sum, or did you pay for everything separately? However, I know you
      are not a man to bother over details, so I conclude that you gave her a
      round sum.
    </p>

      M. DE SALLUS

      Madeline, you are absolutely unbearable.

    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Follow me closely. When you began to neglect me, you took away three
      horses from our stables&mdash;one of them was mine and the other two were
      yours. Then you took away a coachman and a footman; you then found it
      necessary to make me economize at home in order that you might be
      extravagant abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      M. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      That is not true.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! yes, it is. I have every date; do not deny it, for I shall confound
      you if you do. You also stopped giving me jewels, for, of course, you had
      other ears, other fingers, other wrists, and other necks to adorn. You
      also deprived me of one of my nights at the Opéra, and I do not know how
      many other things less important. And all this, according to my idea,
      should mean about five thousand francs a month. Am I not right?

      Allow me. When you took your wealth&mdash;the wealth which was also partly
      mine by marriage&mdash;to pay for your folly, you committed an action that
      was more than doubtful. In fact, it was criminal, for you ruined me at the
      same time you ruined yourself. I use your own language. I have refrained
      from asking you more about the folly that is in question; moreover, the
      five thousand francs that you must give me will be spent upon your own
      house. You must admit that is practical economy. But I know you; I know
      that you are never in love with anything that is lawful and right; so in
      paying dearly&mdash;very dearly, because I shall probably seek an increase&mdash;for
      what you have the right to take, you will find our&mdash;<i>liaison</i>&mdash;far

      You are just the kind of man I took you to be. After paying your numerous
      mistresses, you actually consent to pay me as if I were like them&mdash;without
      any feeling of disgust or realizing the difference in our situation. You
      have said that I asked too much, you have pleaded the fear of ridicule,
      but you could not understand that you were consenting to <i>buy</i> me&mdash;<i>me</i>&mdash;your
      <i>wife</i>! You wished to possess me for a little, as a sort of variation
      to your usual list, although your heart must have told you that it was
      degrading to me to be placed on such a plane. You did not recoil from such
      an idea, but pursued it, just as you pursue them, and the more eagerly,
      because I was more expensive. But you have deceived yourself, not me. Not
      thus will you ever regain possession of your wife. Adieu, Monsieur! [<i>Throws

      No. That in itself, however, is not of much importance, for I believe he
      really likes you. But, after that, he told me of his love for me. Perhaps
      I was a little too insolent, too disdainful. I do not know exactly how far
      I went; but I found myself in such a perplexing, such a painful, such an
      extraordinary situation, that I dared everything to escape it.

      The next day, during luncheon, he was sulky, irritable, and gloomy. Then,
      as he was rising from the table, he said, &ldquo;I have not forgotten your
      behavior of yesterday, and shall not let you forget it. You wish for war,
      let it be war; but I warn you that I shall conquer you, because I am your
      master.&rdquo; I answered him, &ldquo;Be it so; but if you drive me to extremity, take
      care,&mdash;it is not always safe to make a woman desperate.&rdquo;

      I ordered my carriage. And then, as soon as Joseph had gone out, my

      &ldquo;Today, or to-morrow&mdash;it matters not which.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Little or nothing. He either sneers or insolently asks whether I am less
      savage to-day. Last night at the table he brought out a little book, which
      he read during dinner. As I did not wish to appear embarrassed or anxious,
      and desired to maintain my dignity, I said: &ldquo;Your manners toward me are
      certainly exceedingly courteous.&rdquo; He smiled and replied: &ldquo;What did you
      say?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is strange that, for reading, you should choose the time that we
      are together,&rdquo; I said. He answered: &ldquo;Great heavens! It is all your fault,
      since you do not care to be amiable. Besides, this little book is very
      interesting. It is the Civil Code. Perhaps you would like to become
      acquainted with some clauses in it. They would certainly interest you.&rdquo;
       Then he read me the law concerning marriage; the duties of a wife and the
      rights of a husband. Then he looked me full in the face, and asked me
      whether I understood. I answered in the same tone that I understood too
      much,&mdash;especially did I understand the kind of man I had married.
      Then I went out and I have not seen him since.

    <p>

      No. He lunched alone. As for myself, I have thought over the situation,
      and have decided not to meet him <i>tête-à-tête</i> any more.

      But are you quite sure that at bottom his attitude is not induced by
      anger, by wounded vanity, by disappointment, and perhaps by a little
      bravado? Possibly he will behave himself better in future. To-night he is
      at the Opéra. The Santelli has scored a great success in &ldquo;Mahomet,&rdquo; and I
      think she has invited him to supper after the performance. Now, if the
      supper is very much to his taste, he will probably be in good humor when
      he comes home.

    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS

    <p>
      Oh! How provoking you are. Can&rsquo;t you understand that I am in the power of
      this man, that I belong to him even more than his valet or his dog,
      because he has those abominable legal rights over me? The Code, your
      barbarous Code, puts me entirely in his power without any possible defense
      on my part; save actually killing me, he can do everything. Can&rsquo;t you
      understand that? Can&rsquo;t you realize the horror of my situation? Imagine,
      save actual murder, he can do anything to me, and he has the strength&mdash;not
      only physical but legal&mdash;to obtain anything from me. And I, I have
      not a single avenue of escape from a man whom I despise and hate. And that
      is the law made by you men! He took me, married me, deserted me. On my
      part, I have an absolutely moral right to leave him. And yet, despite this
      righteous hatred, this overpowering disgust, this loathing which creeps
      through me in the presence of the man who has scorned me, deceived me, and
      who has fluttered, right under my eyes, from girl to girl&mdash;this man,
      I say, has the right to demand from me a shameful and infamous concession.
      I have no right to hide myself; I have no right even to a key to my own
      door. Everything belongs to him&mdash;the key, the door, and even the
      woman who hates him. It is monstrous! Can you imagine such a horrible
      situation? That a woman should not be mistress of herself, should not even
      have the sacred right of preserving her person from a loathsome stain? And
      all this is the consequence of the infamous law which you men have made!

      I know it. But when you have neither mother nor father to protect you,

      degrading transactions to which many women yield themselves, there is
      always one means of escape.

      No; so much the better. The scandal of it will prevent him from taking me
      back. I have gained courage now. Since he forces me to dishonor, I shall
      see that that dishonor is complete and overwhelming&mdash;even though it
      be the worse for him and for me.

      Oh! Beware, beware, my darling! You are in one of those moments of

    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS

      Well, I would rather commit such a folly and ruin myself&mdash;if that be

      I am threatened.

      Madeline, hear me. You are in a terrible situation, but for God&rsquo;s sake do
      not throw yourself into one that is irretrievable. Be calm, I implore you.

    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL
    </p>

      I do not know; we shall see. But I do not, I cannot, advise you to venture
      on a scandal which will put you outside the pale of society.

    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, yes, there is another law, an unwritten law which permits one to
      have lovers, even though it be shameful, because [<i>sarcastically</i>] it
      does not outrage society.

      That is not the question. The thing is to avoid taking up a wrong position

    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL
    </p>

      Yes, you could hide yourself, but it would be necessary for you to live
      abroad under another name, or buried in the country, till death. That is
      the curse of our love. In three months you would hate me. I never will let
      you commit such a folly.

      should hate me, but, bound to me by this flight that you propose, you
      would carry with you forever a keen and unavailing regret that I allowed
      you to do it.

      I have done exactly what I ought to have done; I have said exactly what I

      JACQUES DE RANDOL

    <p>
      Will you ever understand me? Listen to me. When I first realized that I
      adored you, I made a solemn vow concerning what might happen between you
      and me. The man who falls in love with a woman such as you, a woman
      married yet deserted; a slave in fact yet morally free, institutes between
      her and himself a bond which only she can break. The woman risks
      everything. Ay, it is just because she does this, because she gives
      everything&mdash;her heart, her body, her soul, her honor, her life,
      because she has foreseen all the miseries, all the dangers, all the
      misfortunes that can happen, because she dares to take so bold, and
      fearless a step, and because she is ready and determined to hazard
      everything&mdash;a husband who could kill her, and a world that would
      scorn her&mdash;it is for all this and for the heroism of her conjugal
      infidelity, that her lover, in taking her, ought to foresee all, to guard
      her against every ill that can possibly happen. I have nothing more to
      say. I spoke at first as a calm and foreseeing man who wished to protect
      you against everything&mdash;now I am simply and only the man who loves
      you. Order me as you please.

    <p>
      On the contrary, my dear fellow, you know I like you. And if you would
      acquire the habit of coming into your own house without ringing the bell,
      you would never find me taking my leave when you come.

    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, yes; but a ring of the bell always makes me feel that I must go, and
      surely, coming into your own house, you can dispense with that habit.

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      M. DE SALLUS
    </p>

      I don&rsquo;t understand you.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, it is very simple. When I visit people whom I like, such as Madame de
      Sallus and yourself, I do not expect to meet the Paris that flutters from
      house to house in the evening, gossiping and scandalizing. I have had my
      experience of gossip and tittle-tattle. It needs only one of these
      talkative dames or men to take away all the pleasure there is for me in
      visiting the lady on whom I happen to have called. Sometimes when I am
      anchored perforce upon my seat, I feel lost; I do not know how to get
      away. I have to take part in the whirlpool of foolish chatter. I know all
      the set questions and answers better than I do the catechism itself, and
      it bores me to have to remain until the very end and hear the very last
      opinion of some fool upon the comedy, or the book, or the divorce, or the
      marriage, or the death that is being discussed. Now, do you understand why
      I always get up and go at the sound of a bell?
    </p>
    <p>
      M. DE SALLUS [<i>laughs</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      What you say is very true. Drawing-rooms now are not habitable from four
      o&rsquo;clock to seven, and our wives have no right to complain if we leave them
      to go to the club.

    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS [<i>sarcastically</i>]

      Nevertheless, I do not see my way to receiving ballet girls, or chorus
      girls, or actresses, or so-called painters, poets, musicians, and others&mdash;in
      order to keep you near me.

    </p>
    <p>
      M. DE SALLUS

      I do not ask so much as that. All I desire is a few witty fellows, some
      charming women, and by no means a crowd.

      Ha, ha, ha! What a charming little intimate circle you would bring to me!
      Ha, ha, ha! The fascinating men, and the fashionable women that you would
      invite! My dear sir, it is I who would leave the house then.

      M. DE SALLUS

      You understand very well what I wish to say, and it is not necessary for

      me better than I could possibly be pleased elsewhere.

      More than admirable. She never sang better. In the first act she has a
      long recitative: &ldquo;O God of all believers, hear my prayer,&rdquo; which made the
      body of the house rise to their feet. And in the third act, after that
      phrase, &ldquo;Bright heaven of beauty,&rdquo; I never saw such enthusiasm.

      You know her well, don&rsquo;t you?

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      M. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, yes, for some time back. I had supper with her and some of her friends
      after the performance.

    </p>
    <p>
      M. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      No, about a dozen. You know she is rather particular.

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL.

      It is pleasant to be intimate with her, is it not?

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      M. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Exquisite! And then, you know, she is a woman in a million. I do not know
      whether you agree with me, but I find there are so few women that are
      really women.

      M. DE SALLUS

      Yes, and you have found out that there are women who have a feminine air,
      but who are not women.

      M. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Good gracious! Our society women, with very rare exceptions, are simply
      pictures; they are pretty; they are distinguished; but they charm you only
      in their drawing-rooms. The part they play consists entirely in making men
      admire their dress, their dainty ways, all of which are assumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL
    </p>
    <p>
      Men love them, nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      M. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, very rarely, my dear fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JACQUES DE RANDOL
    </p>
    <p>
      Pardon me!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      M. DE SALLUS
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, yes, dreamers do. But men&mdash;real men&mdash;men who are passionate,
      men who are positive, men who are tender, do not love the society woman of
      to-day, since she is incapable of love. My dear fellow, look around you.
      You see intrigues&mdash;everyone sees them; but can you lay your finger
      upon a single real love affair&mdash;a love that is disinterested, such a
      love as there used to be&mdash;inspired by a single woman of our
      acquaintance? Don&rsquo;t I speak the truth? It flatters a man to have a
      mistress&mdash;it flatters him, it amuses him, and then it tires him. But
      turn to the other picture and look at the woman of the stage. There is not
      one who has not at least five or six love affairs on the carpet; idiotic
      follies, causing bankruptcy, scandal, and suicides. Men love them; yes,
      they love these women because these women know how to inspire love, and
      because they are loving women. Yes, indeed, <i>they</i> know how to
      conquer men; they understand the seduction of a smile; they know how to
      attract, seize, and wrap us up in their hearts, how to enslave us with a
      look, and they need not be beautiful at that. They have a conquering power
      that we never find in our wives.

    </p>
    <p>
      M. DE SALLUS

      A woman of that sort does not give herself the trouble of making men run
      after her unless she has some further object in view.

    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS

      That sort of happiness has but little attraction for me. I like the

    </p>
    <p>

      Oh, my dear Randol; it is only for such women that men commit follies, and
      [<i>sarcastically</i>], understand me, the measure of a man&rsquo;s folly is
      often the measure of his love.

    <p>
      M. DE SALLUS [<i>from the same place</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, no, my dear girl,&mdash;men do not marry them, and marriage is the
      only real folly that a man can commit with a woman.

    <p>
      MME. DE SALLUS

    <p>
      Ah, men are sad creatures! They marry a young girl because she is demure
      and self-contained, and they leave her on the morrow to dangle after a
      girl who is not young and who certainly is not demure, her chief
      attraction being that all the rich and well-known men about town have at
      one time been in her favor. The more danglers she has after her, the more
      she is esteemed, the more she is sought after, and the more she is
      respected; that is to say, with that kind of Parisian respect which
      accrues to a woman in the degree of her notoriety&mdash;a notoriety due
      either to the scandal she creates, or the scandal men create about her.
      Ah, yes, you men are so nice in these things!

    </p>
    <p>
      This is the sort of marriage that I like&mdash;a marriage that, in this
      Paris of yours, you don&rsquo;t have very often. After the wedding breakfast,
      which takes place directly after you come from the church, all the guests
      go home, even the maids of honor and the ushers. The married couple remain
      at home and dine with their parents or relatives. In the evening they play
      billiards or cards, just as on an ordinary night; the newly married couple
      entertain each other. [Gilberte <i>and</i> Jean <i>rise, and hand in hand
      slowly retire</i> C.] Then, before midnight, good night!
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE RONCHARD [<i>aside</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Which is altogether very <i>bourgeois</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MARTINEL [<i>sits</i> R. <i>upon the sofa beside</i> Mme. de Ronchard]
    </p>
    <p>
      As to newly married couples&mdash;instead of going on that absurd and
      traditional thing you call a honeymoon, it is far better for them to go at
      once to the apartment or house prepared for them. I dare say you will
      think my plan lacking in fashion and display, but I cannot help that. For
      myself, I must say that I like absence of all ostentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE RONCHARD
    </p>
    <p>
      Your plan is not according to the customs of polite society, Monsieur.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MARTINEL
    </p>
    <p>
      Polite society, indeed! Why, there are thirty-six different kinds of
      polite society. For instance, take Havre.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE RONCHARD [<i>interrupts</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      I know only ours. [<i>Corrects herself.</i>] That is, I mean to say, mine,
      which is the correct one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MARTINEL
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, naturally, naturally! Nevertheless, simple as it may be, this marriage
      is an acknowledged fact, and I hope that you have taken into your good
      books my dear nephew, who, until now&mdash;

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE RONCHARD

    <p>
      I can hardly help doing so since he is my brother&rsquo;s son-in-law, and my
      niece&rsquo;s husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MARTINEL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, that is not the only thing, is it? I am very happy that the affair
      is over&mdash;although my life has been spent in the midst of
      difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

      MME. DE RONCHARD

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MARTINEL
    </p>
    <p>
      I mean commercial difficulties, not matrimonial.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE RONCHARD
    </p>
    <p>
      What commercial difficulties can you have&mdash;you, a Croesus who has
      just given five hundred thousand francs in dowry to his nephew. [<i>With a
      sigh.</i>] Five hundred thousand francs! Just what my late husband
      squandered.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MARTINEL
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! Yes, I know that, Madame de Ronchard.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE RONCHARD [<i>sighs again</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      I was ruined and deserted after just one year of married life, Monsieur&mdash;one
      year. I just had time to realize how happy I could be, for the scoundrel,
      the wretch, knew how to make me love him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MARTINEL
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he was a scoundrel?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE RONCHARD
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! Monsieur, he was a man of fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MARTINEL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, that did not prevent him from&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE RONCHARD
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, don&rsquo;t let us talk any more about my misfortunes. It would be too long
      and too sad, and everybody else is so happy here just now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MARTINEL
    </p>
    <p>
      And I am happier than anybody else, I assure you. My nephew is such a good
      fellow. I love him as I would a son. Now, as for myself, I made my fortune
      in trade&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE RONCHARD [<i>aside</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      That is very evident.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MARTINEL [<i>resumes</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sea-going trade. But my nephew will gain fame for our name by his
      renown as an artist; the only difference between us is that he makes his
      fortune with his brushes, and I have made mine with ships. Art, to-day,
      Madame, may be as important as trade, but it is less profitable. Take my
      nephew. Although he has made a very early success, it is I who have
      enabled him to. When my poor brother died, his wife following him almost
      immediately, I found myself, while quite a young man, left alone with this
      baby. Well, I made him learn everything that I could. He studied
      chemistry, music, and literature, but he had a leaning toward art more
      than to the other things. I assure you that I encouraged him in it, and
      you see how he has succeeded. He is only just thirty, is well known, and
      has just been decorated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE RONCHARD [<i>dryly</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirty years old, and only just decorated; that is slow for an artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MARTINEL
    </p>
    <p>
      Pshaw! He will make up for lost time. [<i>Rises</i>] But I am afraid I am
      getting boastful. You must pardon me, I am a plain man, and just now a
      little exhilarated by dining. It is all Petitpré&rsquo;s fault. His Burgundy is
      excellent. It is a wine that you may say is a friend to wisdom. And we are
      accustomed to drink a good deal at Havre. [<i>Takes up his glass of brandy
      and finishes it.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE RONCHARD [<i>aside</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely that is enough about Havre.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MARTINEL [<i>turns to</i> Mme. de Ronchard]
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, there is a treaty between us&mdash;a treaty which will last&mdash;which
      no foolishness can break, such as that which has failed to break this
      marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE RONCHARD [<i>rises and crosses</i> L.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Foolishness! You speak very lightly about it. But now that the marriage is
      a thing accomplished, it is all right. I had destined my niece for another
      sphere than a painter&rsquo;s world. However, when you can&rsquo;t get a thrush, eat a
      blackbird, as the proverb says.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MARTINEL
    </p>
    <p>
      But a white blackbird, Madame, for your niece is a pearl. Let me tell you,
      the happiness of these children will be the happiness of my declining
      years.

      LÉON [<i>comes down stage</i>]

      You are like my father. It seems to me that when anyone begins to like
      billiards at all, they become infatuated with the game; and you two people
      are two of a kind.

      MARTINEL
    </p>
    <p>
      My son, when a man grows old, and has no family, he has to take refuge in
      such pleasures as these. If you take bait-fishing as your diversion in the
      morning and billiards for the afternoon and evening, you have two kinds of
      amusement that are both worthy and attractive.

    <p>
      LÉON

    <p>
      Oh, ho! Bait-fishing, indeed! That means to say, getting up early and
      sitting with your feet in the water through wind and rain in the hope of
      catching, perhaps each quarter of an hour, a fish about the size of a
      match. And you call that an attractive pastime?

      I do, without a doubt. But do you believe that there is a single lover in
      the world capable of doing as much for his mistress throughout ten,
      twelve, or fifteen years of life? If you asked my opinion, I think he
      would give it up at the end of a fortnight.

      that the marriage has taken place, I feel very happy. Do you understand
      me? It is a triumph for me, and I must confess that I feel very triumphant
      this evening. Tomorrow, however, vanish the triumpher, and there will
      remain only your affectionate little nephew. Come, smile, Auntie. At heart
      you are not as ill-natured as you pretend to be, and that is proved by the

      Do you reproach Jean for his good looks? If you do, my dear Aunt, there
      are a good many men in the world who must plead guilty. Suppose, even,
      that a man has no need of good looks, it does not follow that he ought to
      be ugly.

    </p>
    <p>
      LÉON
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have cost you a great deal more if he had been ugly! [Mme. de
      Ronchard <i>rises to go away</i>.] Besides Jean is not only good-looking
      but he is good. He is not vain, but modest; and he has genius, which is
      manifesting itself more and more every day. He will certainly attain
      membership in the Institute. That would please you, would it not? That
      would be worth more than a simple engineer; and, moreover, every woman
      finds him charming, except you.

    <p>
      MME. DE RONCHARD

    <p>
      That&rsquo;s the very thing for which I blame him. He is too good and too
      honest. He has already painted the portraits of a crowd of women, and he
      will continue to do that. They will be alone with him in his studio for
      hours at a time, and everybody knows what goes on in those studios.

      Well, what I say of Jean, I say of all artists&mdash;that they ought not
      to be allowed to marry into a family of lawyers and magistrates, such as
      ours. Such doings always bring trouble. I ask you as a man, is it possible
      to be a good husband under such conditions&mdash;among a crowd of women
      continually around you who do nothing but unrobe and re-dress themselves,
      whether they be clients or models (<i>pointedly</i>), especially models?
      [Mme. de Ronchard <i>rises and</i> Léon <i>is silent</i>.] I said <i>models</i>,

      I understand you, Aunt. You make a very pointed and delicate allusion to
      Jean&rsquo;s past. Well, what of it? If he did have one of his models for a
      mistress, he loved her, and loved her sincerely for three years&mdash;

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      Whether it be essential or not, it is nevertheless very nice to be pretty.

      exceptionally tender, good, and sincere.

      Listen. The truth is, that it happened to Jean as it has happened to many
      others besides him&mdash;that is to say, there was a pretty little
      nineteen-year-old girl whom he met, whom he loved, and with whom he
      established an intimacy little by little&mdash;an intimacy which lasted
      one, two, three years&mdash;the usual duration of that sort of thing.
      Then, as usually happens, there came a rupture&mdash;a rupture which is
      sometimes violent, sometimes gentle, but which is never altogether
      good-natured. Then also, as usual in such cases, each went a separate way&mdash;the
      eternal ending, which is always prosaic, because it is true to life. But
      the one thing that distinguishes Jean&rsquo;s <i>liaison</i> from the usual
      affair is the truly admirable character of the girl in the case.

      No, no; not Musette. Musotte, with an O instead of an E. She is named
      Musotte because of her pretty little nose; can&rsquo;t you understand? Musotte,
      the name explains itself.

      My dear Aunt, it is only a nickname. The nick-name of a model. Her true
      name is Henriette Lévêque.

    <p>
      Yes, Lévêque. What does this questioning mean? It is just as I told you,
      or else I know nothing about it. Now, Henriette Lévêque, or Musotte, if
      you prefer that term, has not only been faithful to Jean during the course
      of her love affair with him; has not only been devoted and adoring, and
      full of a tenderness which was ever watchful, but at the very hour of her
      rupture with him, she gave proof of her greatness of soul. She accepted
      everything without reproach, without recrimination; the poor little girl
      understood everything&mdash;understood that all was finished and finished
      forever. With the intuition of a woman, she felt that Jean&rsquo;s love for my
      sister was real and deep, she bowed her head to circumstances and she
      departed, accepting, without a murmur, the loneliness that Jean&rsquo;s action
      brought upon her. She carried her fidelity to the end, for she would have
      slain herself sooner than become [<i>hesitating out of respect for</i>
      Mme. de Ronchard] a courtesan. And this I <i>know</i>.

      Not once; and that is more than eight months ago. He wished for news of
      her, and he gave me the task of getting it. I never found her and I have
      never been able to gain any knowledge of her, so cunningly did she arrange
      this flight of hers&mdash;this flight which was so noble and so
      self-sacrificing. [<i>Changing his tone.</i>] But I don&rsquo;t know why I
      repeat all this. You know it just as well as I do, for I have told it to
      you a dozen times.

      to marry my sister to such a man as he. The future will tell you whether I
      was right or not. [<i>Coaxingly.</i>] And then, my dear Aunt, when later

      as you spoke and loves as you appear to love, but at the same time, they
      will be different.

      What drew me to you was the mysterious harmony between your natural form
      and the soul within it. Do you recollect my first visit to this house?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      GILBERTE
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, yes, very well. My brother brought you to dinner, and I believe that
      you did not wish to come.

    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [<i>laughs</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      If that were true, it was very indiscreet of your brother to tell you. And
      he told you that? I am annoyed that he did so, and I confess I did
      hesitate somewhat, for you know I was an artist accustomed to the society
      of artists, which is lively, witty, and sometimes rather free, and I felt
      somewhat disturbed at the idea of entering a house so serious as yours&mdash;a
      house peopled by dignified lawyers and young ladies. But I was so fond of
      your brother, I found him so full of novelty, so gay, so wittily sarcastic
      and discerning, under his assumed levity, that not only did I go
      everywhere with him, but I followed him to the extent of meeting you. And
      I never cease to thank him for it. Do you remember when I entered the
      drawing-room where you and your family were sitting, you were arranging in
      a china vase some flowers that had just been sent to you?

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      Your father spoke to me of my Uncle Martinel, whom he had formerly known.
      This at once formed a link between us, for all the time that I was talking
      to him I was watching you arrange your flowers.
    </p>

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      GILBERTE [<i>smiles</i>]

      You looked far too long and too steadfastly for a first introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      I was looking at you as an artist looks, and was admiring you, for I found
      your figure, your movements, and your entire self attractive. And then for
      the last six months I have often come to this house, to which your brother
      invited me and whither your presence attracted me, and finally I felt your
      sway as a lover feels the sway of the one he adores. There was an
      inexplicable, unseen attraction calling me to you. [<i>Sits beside her</i>
      R. <i>of table</i>.] Then a dim idea entered my brain,&mdash;an idea that
      one day you might become my wife. It gained possession of my soul, and I
      immediately took steps to renew the friendship between your father and my
      uncle. The two men again became friends. Did you never divine my
      maneuvers?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      GILBERTE
    </p>
    <p>
      Divine your maneuvers? No, I suspected a little at times, but I was so
      astounded that a man like you&mdash;in the full flush of success, so well
      known, so sought after&mdash;should concern himself with such a little,
      unimportant girl as I, that, really, I could place no faith in the
      sincerity of your attention.

      JEAN

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      GILBERTE
    </p>
    <p>
      Your character pleased me. I felt that you were loyal, and then you
      entertained me greatly, for you brought into our house that artistic air
      which gave my fancies life. I ought to tell you that my brother had
      already warned me that I should like you. You know that Léon loves you.

    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      I know it, and I think it was in <i>his</i> brain that the first idea of
      our marriage had birth. [<i>After a short silence</i>] You remember our
      return from Saint-Germain after we had dined in the Henri IV. Pavilion?

      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      My uncle and your aunt were in the front of the landau, and you and I on
      the rear seat, and in another carriage were your father and Léon. What a
      glorious spring night! But how coldly you treated me!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      GILBERTE

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      You ought to recall that I put to you that day a question which I had
      already asked you, because you cannot deny that I had paid you very tender
      attention and that you had captured my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      GILBERTE
    </p>
    <p>
      True. Nevertheless it surprised and upset me. Oh, how often have I
      remembered it since! But I have never been able to recall the very words
      you used. Do you remember them?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      No; they came from my lips, issuing from the bottom of my heart like a
      prayer for mercy. I only know that I told you that I should never re-enter
      your house if you did not give me some little hope that there should be a
      day when you would know me better. You pondered a long time before you
      answered me, but you spoke in such a low tone that I was anxious to make
      you repeat it.
    </p>

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      GILBERTE [<i>takes up his sentence and speaks as if in a dream</i>]

      Could anyone forget that? [<i>With deep emotion.</i>] Do you know what I
      think? As we look at each other and examine our hearts, our souls, our

      the true road to happiness. [<i>Kisses her. For a moment they are silent.</i>]

      letter addressed to M. Martinel, without any Christian name by which to
      identify it, but with these words on the letter &ldquo;Exceedingly urgent.&rdquo; I
      thought it was addressed to me, so I tore open the envelope, and I read
      words intended for Jean&mdash;words which have well-nigh taken away my
      reason. I came to find you in order to ask advice, for this is a thing
      which must be decided upon the moment.

      free liver, and a physician to many women of the world, and one who would

      evening, above every other evening, upon such a subject as this. But I am
      sure that if I did otherwise you would never forgive me. Your former
      mistress, Henriette Lévêque, is dying and would bid you farewell. [<i>Throws
      a glance at</i> Martinel <i>who signs to him to continue.</i>] She will
      not live through the night. She dies after bringing into the world, some
      fifteen days ago, a child who on her deathbed she swears is yours. So long
      as she was in no danger, she determined to leave you in ignorance of this
      child&rsquo;s existence. But, to-day, doomed to death, she calls to you. I know
      how you have loved her in the past. But you must do as you think fit. She
      lives in the Rue Chaptal at Number 31. Let me know how I can serve you, my

      future&mdash;the whole life of your sister and of Jean. What would you do
      if you were I? Would you keep this confounded letter, or would you give it

      I swear to you, on my faith as a gentleman, that I would have done just as
      Jean has done; that his absolute fidelity to you, his fidelity, which
      perhaps is even exaggerated by love for you, is the only reason which had
      led him to forget at this very moment the very thing that he has gone to

      You are correctly informed, Madame; a letter was delivered here, but I

      Yes, it would have been better to consult you, but the urgency of the
      matter did not allow it. You would have discussed the matter; my aunt
      would have discussed the matter; we should all have discussed the matter
      the whole night long, and you know there are times when one cannot afford
      to lose even seconds. Silence was necessary until Jean&rsquo;s return. When he
      does return he will hide nothing from you, and I feel sure that you will
      judge him as I myself have judged him.

      From a physician&mdash;a physician&mdash;then he must have a sick patient&mdash;and
      it is on account of this patient that he made Jean come to him. But who is
      the patient? Oh, ho! I surmise that it is a woman&mdash;that woman&mdash;his
      former mistress, who has played this card today. Sick! I suppose she has
      made a pretense of poisoning herself in order to show him that she loves
      him still and will always love him. Oh, the little wretch! [<i>To</i>

      What simple ideas you have, Madame Babin! Personally, I would rather not
      know the hour of my death. I would sooner finish my life while sleeping in
      the middle of the night&mdash;during slumber&mdash;without suffering&mdash;by
      a sudden failure of the heart.

      Look at the sick woman. How silly of her to wish to rest upon that
      steamer-chair as she has done. The doctor told her plainly that such an
      effort would probably finish her.

      Oh, I understand her motive. When a girl like her has a lover she commits
      every kind of folly, and more especially, nurse, when they are at all
      coquettish; but you country people do not know anything about such things.
      They are coquettish through and through. That is the reason she wished to
      look her prettiest. She was afraid of being thought ugly, don&rsquo;t you
      understand? So I had to put on her <i>peignoir</i>, and tidy her up, and
      arrange her hair just as I have done.

      Yes, my mother was a midwife, and taught me the business at the same time
      that she taught me dancing, because she always said it was well to have
      two strings to your bow. Dancing, you see, is all very well, provided you
      are not too ambitious of appearing on first nights, but, unhappily, that
      was the case with me. I was as slender as a thread when I was twenty, and
      very agile, but I grew fat and scant of breath, and became rather heavy in
      my steps; so when my mother died, as I had my diploma as a midwife, I took
      her apartment and her business, and I added the title of &ldquo;Midwife to the
      Opera,&rdquo; for all their business comes to me. They like me very much there.
      When I was dancing, they used to call me Mademoiselle Flacchi the
      première.

      I only do you justice. You know that formerly, when I was a young doctor,

      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      And you came immediately?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks&mdash;ah! thanks. I hesitated a long time before warning you&mdash;hesitated
      even this morning, but I heard the midwife talking with the nurse and
      learned that to-morrow perhaps it might be too late, so I sent Doctor
      Pellerin to call you immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      Why didn&rsquo;t you call me sooner?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      I never thought that my illness would become so serious. I did not wish to
      trouble your life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [<i>points to the cradle</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      But that child! How is it that I was not told of this sooner?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      You would never have known it, if his birth had not killed me. I would
      have spared you this pain&mdash;this cloud upon your life. When you left
      me, you gave me enough to live upon. Everything was over between us; and
      besides, at any other moment than this, would you believe me if I said to
      you: &ldquo;This is your child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I have never doubted you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      You are as good as ever, my Jean. No, no, I am not lying to you; he is
      yours, that little one there. I swear it to you on my deathbed; I swear it
      to you before God!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      I have already told you that I believed you. I have always believed you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      Listen, this is all that has happened. As soon as you left me, I became
      very ill. I suffered so much that I thought I was going to die. The doctor
      ordered a change of air. You remember, it was in the spring. I went to
      Saint-Malo&mdash;to that old relative, of whom I have often talked to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in Saint-Malo, after some days, that I realized that you had left
      me a pledge of your affection. My first desire was to tell you everything,
      for I knew that you were an honest man&mdash;that you would have
      recognized this child, perhaps even have given up your marriage; but I
      would not have had you do that. All was over; was it not?&mdash;and it was
      better that it should be so. I knew that I could never be your wife [<i>smiles</i>],
      Musotte, me, Madame Martinel&mdash;oh, no!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      My poor, dear girl. How brutal and hard we men are, without thinking of it
      and without wishing to be so!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      Don&rsquo;t say that. I was not made for you. I was only a little model; and
      you, you were a rising artist, and I never thought that you would belong
      to me forever. [Jean <i>sheds tears</i>.] No, no, don&rsquo;t cry; you have
      nothing to reproach yourself with. You have always been so good to me. It
      is only God who has been cruel to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      Musotte!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me go on. I remained at Saint-Malo without revealing my condition.
      Then I came back to Paris, and here some months afterward the little one
      was born&mdash;the child! When I fully understood what had happened to me,
      I experienced at first such fear; yes, such fear! Then I remembered that
      he was bone of your bone, and flesh of your flesh; that you had given him
      life, and that he was a pledge from you. But one is so stupid when one
      knows nothing. One&rsquo;s ideas change just as one&rsquo;s moods change, and I became
      contented all at once; contented with the thought that I would bring him
      up, that he would grow to be a man, that he would call me mother. [<i>Weeps.</i>]
      Now, he will never call me mother. He will never put his little arms
      around my neck, because I am going to leave him; because I am going away&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t know where; but there, where everybody goes. Oh, God! My God!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      Calm yourself, my little Musotte. Would you be able to speak as you do
      speak if you were as ill as you think you are?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      You do not see that the fever is burning within me; that I am losing my
      head, and don&rsquo;t know longer what I say.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no; please calm yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      Pet me; pet me, Jean, and you will calm me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [<i>kisses her hair; then resumes</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      There, there; don&rsquo;t speak any more for a minute or two. Let us remain
      quietly here near each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      But I must speak to you; I have so many things to say to you yet, and do
      not know how to say them. My head is beyond my control. Oh, my God! how
      shall I do it? [<i>Raises herself, looks around her and sees the cradle.</i>]
      Ah, yes, I know; I recollect, it is he, my child. Tell me, Jean, what will
      you do with him? You know that I am an orphan, and when I am gone he will
      be here all alone&mdash;alone in the world! Poor little thing! Listen,
      Jean, my head is quite clear now. I shall understand very well what you
      answer me now, and the peace of my closing moments depends upon it. I have
      no one to leave the little one to but you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      I promise you that I will take him, look after him, and bring him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      Go and look at him again. [Jean <i>goes over to the cradle.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN

    <p>
      He is pretty, isn&rsquo;t he?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody says so. Look at him, the poor little darling, who has enjoyed
      only a few days of life as yet. He belongs to us. You are his father; I am
      his mother, but soon he will have a mother no more. [<i>In anguish.</i>]
      Promise me that he shall always have a father.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [<i>goes over to her</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      I promise it, my darling!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      A true father, who will always love him well?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN I promise it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      You will be good&mdash;very good&mdash;to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      I swear it to you!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, there is something else&mdash;but I dare not&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      Tell it to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I came back to Paris, I have sought to see you without being seen by
      you, and I have seen you three times. Each time you were with her&mdash;with
      your sweetheart, your wife, and with a gentleman&mdash;her father, I
      think. Oh, how I looked at her! I asked myself: &ldquo;Will she love him as I
      have loved him? Will she make him happy? Is she good?&rdquo; Tell me, do you
      really believe she is very good?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, darling, I believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      You are very certain of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      And I thought so, too, simply from seeing her pass by. She is so pretty! I
      have been a little jealous, and I wept on coming back. But what are you
      going to do now as between her and your son?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall do my duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      Your duty? Does that mean by her or by him?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      By him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      Listen, Jean: when I am no more, ask your wife from me, from the mouth of
      a dead woman, to adopt him, this dear little morsel of humanity-to love
      him as I would have loved him; to be a mother to him in my stead. If she
      is tender and kind, she will consent. Tell her how you saw me suffer&mdash;that
      my last prayer, my last supplication on earth was offered up for her. Will
      you do this?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN
    </p>
    <p>
      I promise you that I will.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! How good you are! Now I fear nothing; my poor little darling is safe,
      and I am happy and calm. Ah, how calm I am! You didn&rsquo;t know, did you, that
      I called him Jean, after you? That does not displease you, does it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN [<i>weeps</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      You weep&mdash;so you still love me a little, Jean? Ah, how I thank you
      for this! But if I only could live; it must be possible. I feel so much
      better since you came here, and since you have promised me all that I have
      asked you. Give me your hand. At this moment I can recall all our life
      together, and I am content&mdash;almost gay; in fact, I can laugh&mdash;see,
      I can laugh, though I don&rsquo;t know why. [<i>Laughs.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      JEAN

    <p>
      Oh, calm yourself for my sake, dear little Musotte.

    <p>
      MUSOTTE
    </p>
    <p>
      If you could only understand how recollections throng upon me. Do you
      remember that I posed for your &ldquo;Mendiante,&rdquo; for your &ldquo;Violet Seller,&rdquo; for
      your &ldquo;Guilty Woman,&rdquo; which won for you your first medal? And do you
      remember the breakfast at Ledoyen&rsquo;s on Varnishing Day? There were more
      than twenty-five at a table intended for ten. What follies we committed,
      especially that little, little&mdash;what did he call himself&mdash;I mean
      that little comic fellow, who was always making portraits which resembled
      no one? Oh, yes, Tavernier! And you took me home with you to your studio,
      where you had two great manikins which frightened me so, and I called to
      you, and you came in to reassure me. Oh, how heavenly all that was! Do you
      remember? [<i>Laughs again</i>.] Oh, if that life could only begin over
      again! [<i>Cries suddenly</i>.] Ah, what pain! [<i>To</i> Jean, <i>who is
      going for the doctor</i>.] No, stay, stay! [<i>Silence. A sudden change
      comes over her face</i>.] See, Jean, what glorious weather! If you like,
      we will take the baby for a sail on a river steamboat; that will be so
      jolly! I love those little steamboats; they are so pretty. They glide over
      the water quickly and without noise. Now that I am your wife, I can assert
      myself&mdash;I am armed. Darling, I never thought that you would marry me.
      And look at our little one&mdash;how pretty he is, and how he grows! He is
      called Jean after you. And I&mdash;I have my two little Jeans&mdash;mine&mdash;altogether
      mine! You don&rsquo;t know how happy I am. And the little one walks to-day for
      the first time! [<i>Laughs aloud, with her arms stretched out, pointing to

      No doubt you are right from your point of view of a married woman; but
      there are other points of view, perhaps less selfish and certainly
      superior, such as that of family interest.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE RONCHARD

      Of family interest, indeed? Do you mean to say that I was wrong from the

    </p>
    <p>
      PETITPRÉ
    </p>
    <p>
      My duties as a magistrate have made me very prudent, for I have seen pass
      under my eyes many equivocal and terrible situations, which not only
      agonized my conscience but gave me many cruel hours of indecision. Man is
      often so little responsible and circumstances are often so powerful. Our
      impenetrable nature is so capricious, our instincts are so mysterious that
      we must be tolerant and even indulgent in the presence of faults which are
      not really crimes, and which exhibit nothing vicious or abandoned in the
      man himself.

    <p>
      MME. DE RONCHARD

    <p>
      PETITPRÉ [<i>rises</i>]

    <p>
      It is not almost a crime,&mdash;it is one. But it is looked upon to-day as
      so common a thing that one scarcely punishes it at all. It is punished by
      divorce, which is a house of refuge for most men. The law prefers to
      separate them with decency&mdash;timidly, rather than drag them apart as
      in former times.

      PETITPRÉ [<i>who has finished reading the letter</i>]

    <p>
      Then, Martinel, you say that your nephew was ignorant of the situation of
      this woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MARTINEL

    </p>
    <p>
      It is incredible.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MARTINEL
    </p>
    <p>
      I will answer you in a word. If my nephew had known of this situation,
      would he have done what he has this evening?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      PETITPRÉ
    </p>
    <p>
      Explain yourself more clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MARTINEL
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very simple. If he had known sooner of the danger this woman was in,
      do you think that he would have waited until the last moment, and have
      chosen this very evening&mdash;this supreme moment&mdash;to say good-bye
      to this poor, dying woman, and to reveal to you the existence of his
      illegitimate son? No, men hide these unfortunate children when and how
      they please. You know that as well as I, Monsieur. To run the risk of
      throwing us all into such a state of emotion and threatening his own
      future, as he has done, it would seem that Jean must be a madman, and he
      is by no means that. Had he known sooner of this situation, do you think
      that he would not have confided in me, and that I would have been so
      stupid&mdash;yes, I&mdash;as not to avert this disaster? Why, I tell you
      it is as clear as day.

      MME. DE RONCHARD [<i>agitated, walks to and fro rapidly</i> L.]

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MARTINEL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, indeed. If we had not received this piece of news as a bomb which
      destroys the power of reflection, if we could have taken time to reason
      the thing out, to make plans, we could have hidden everything from you,
      and the devil would have been in it before you would have known anything!
      Our fault has been that of being too sincere and too loyal. Yet, I do not
      regret it; it is always better to act openly in life.

      PETITPRÉ
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence, Clarisse. [<i>To</i> Martinel.] Be it so, Monsieur. There is no
      question of your honor or of your loyalty, which have been absolutely
      patent in this unfortunate affair. I willingly admit that your nephew knew
      nothing of the situation, but how about the child? What is there to prove
      that it is Jean&rsquo;s?

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MARTINEL
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean alone can prove or disprove that. He believes it, and you know that
      it is not to his interest to believe it. There is nothing very joyful
      about such a complication&mdash;a poor, little foundling thrusting himself
      upon one like a thunderbolt, without warning, and upon the very evening of
      one&rsquo;s marriage. But Jean believes that the child is his, and I&mdash;and
      all of us&mdash;must we not accept it as he has accepted it, as the
      child&rsquo;s father has accepted it? Come, now. [<i>A short silence.</i>] You
      ask me to prove to you that this child belongs to Jean?

      himself. We others can do nothing but accept his decision.

      MARTINEL
    </p>
    <p>
      There can be no better reason, Madame. [<i>To</i> Petitpré.] I was quite
      sure that you would understand me, Monsieur, for you are a man of sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE RONCHARD

    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE RONCHARD
    </p>
    <p>
      And it is exactly as a woman of the world that I protest, Monsieur. You
      have a very pretty way of putting things, but none the less this is a
      fact: Jean Martinel brings to his bride, as a nuptial present, on the day
      of his marriage, an illegitimate child. Well, I ask you, woman of the
      world or not, can she accept such a thing?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      PETITPRÉ
    </p>
    <p>
      My sister is in the right this time, Monsieur Martinel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE RONCHARD
    </p>
    <p>
      And by no means too soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      PETITPRÉ
    </p>
    <p>
      It is evident that a situation exists patent and undeniable, which places
      us in an awkward dilemma. We have wedded our daughter to a man supposedly
      free from all ties and all complications in life, and then comes&mdash;what
      you know has come. The consequences should be endured by him, not by us.
      We have been wounded and deceived in our confidence, and the consent that
      we have given to this marriage we should certainly have refused, had we
      known the actual circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. DE RONCHARD
    </p>
    <p>
      We should have refused? I should say so&mdash;not only once, but twice.
      Besides, this child, if Jean brings it into the house, will certainly be a
      cause of trouble among us all. Consider, Gilberte will probably become a
      mother in her turn, and then what jealousies, what rivalries, what hatred,
      perhaps, will arise between this intruder and her own children. This child
      will be a veritable apple of discord.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MARTINEL
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, no, no! he will not be a burden to anyone. Thanks to Jean&rsquo;s
      liberality, this child&rsquo;s mother will have left him enough to live
      comfortably, and, later, when he has become a man, he will travel, no
      doubt. He will do as I have done; as nine-tenths of the human race do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      PETITPRÉ
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, until then, who will take care of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MARTINEL
    </p>
    <p>
      I, if it is agreeable. I am a free man, retired from business; and it will
      give me something to do, something to distract me. I am ready to take him
      with me at once, the poor little thing&mdash;[<i>looks at</i> Mme. de
      Ronchard] unless Madame, who is so fond of saving lost dogs&mdash;

    </p>
    <p>
      MARTINEL

      willingly.

    </p>
    <p>
      MARTINEL
    </p>
    <p>
      Not as yet, true, but perhaps you will say it before very long, for I am
      beginning to understand you. You are an assumed man-hater and nothing
      else. You have been unhappy in your married life and that has embittered
      you&mdash;just as milk may turn upon its surface, but at the bottom of the
      churn there is butter of fine quality.

    <p>
      Yes, my child; but there are two kinds of misfortune&mdash;those that come
      from the faults of men, and those that spring purely from the hazards of
      fate; that is to say, destiny. In the first case, the man is guilty; in
      the second case, he is a victim. Do you understand me?

      A misfortune of which some one person is the victim can also wound another

      I am too much agitated to tell you yet. This woman, of whom I did not
      think at all, whose very existence was a matter of indifference to me&mdash;her
      death has frightened me. It seems that she has come between Jean and me,
      and will always remain there. Everything that I have heard of her
      prophesies this estrangement. But you knew her&mdash;this woman did you

    <p>
      Yes, Madame, and I can say nothing but good of her. Your brother and I
      have always looked upon her as irreproachable in her fidelity to Jean. She
      loved him with a pure, devoted, absolute, and lasting affection. I speak
      as a man who has deplored deeply this intrigue, for I look upon myself as
      a father to Jean, but we must try to be just to everyone.

      much difference between the life of the imagination and the actual life;
      between that which one ought to do; that which you would that others
      should do, and that which you do yourself. Yes, what has happened is very
      painful; but the surprise of the event, its coincidence with the nuptial
      day makes it still more painful. We magnify&mdash;everything in our
      emotion, when it is ourselves that misfortune touches. Suppose, for a
      moment, that you had read this in your daily newspaper&mdash;

      Or in a romance. What emotion we should feel; what tears we should shed!
      How your sympathy would quickly go out to the poor little child whose
      birth was attained at the cost of his mother&rsquo;s life! How Jean would go up
      in your esteem; how frank, how loyal, how stanch in his fealty you would
      consider him; while, on the other hand, if he had deserted the dying
      woman, and had spirited away the little one into some distant village, you
      would not have had enough scorn for him, or enough insults for him. You
      would look upon him as a being without heart and without fear; and, you,
      my dear Aunt, thinking of the innumerable little bad dogs who owe you
      their lives, you would cry out with forcible gestures: &ldquo;What a miserable
      scoundrel!&rdquo;

      Pshaw! Statistics! You can make them say what you wish. No, no divorce for
      Gilberte. [<i>In a soft, low voice</i>.] Simply a legal separation&mdash;that
      is admissible, at least, and it is good form. Let them separate. I am

      It seems to me that only one person has a right to speak in this matter,
      and we are forgetting her too long. [<i>Turns to Gilberte</i>.] You have
      heard everything, Gilberte; you are mistress of your own judgment and of
      your decision. Upon a word from you depend either pardon or rupture. My
      father has made his argument. What does your heart say? [<i>Gilberte tries
      to speak, but stops and breaks down</i>.] Think always that in refusing to
      pardon Jean you wound me, and if I see you unhappy from your determination
      to say no, I shall suffer exceedingly. Monsieur Martinel asks from you at
      once an answer for Jean. Let us do better. I will go and find him. It is
      from your lips; it is, above all, in your eyes, that he will learn his
      fate. [<i>Brings her gently to the front of the stage</i>.] My little
      sister, my. dear little sister, don&rsquo;t be too proud; don&rsquo;t be too haughty!

      Well, do you know what made me suffer just now when my brother told me of
      this intrigue and death? I can tell it to you now. I was jealous! It was
      unworthy of me, wasn&rsquo;t it? Jealous of this poor, dead woman! But he spoke
      so well of her as to move me, and I felt that she loved you so much that
      you might find me perhaps indifferent and cold after her, and that hurt me
      so! I had so much fear of experiencing that that I thought of renouncing
      you.

    <h2>
      THE LANCER&rsquo;S WIFE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was after Bourbaki&rsquo;s defeat in the east of France. The army, broken up,
      decimated and worn out, had been obliged to retreat into Switzerland,
      after that terrible campaign. It was only the short duration of the
      struggle that saved a hundred and fifty thousand men from certain death.
      Hunger, the terrible cold, and forced marches in the snow without boots,
      over bad mountainous roads, had caused the <i>francs-tireurs</i>
      especially the greatest suffering, for we were without tents and almost
      without food, always in front when we were marching toward Belfort, and in
      the rear when returning by the Jura. Of our brigade, that had numbered
      twelve hundred men on the first of January, there remained only twenty-two
      pale, thin, ragged wretches, when at length we succeeded in reaching Swiss
      territory.
    </p>
    <p>
      There we were safe and could rest. Everybody knows what sympathy was shown
      to the unfortunate French army, and how well it was cared for. We all
      gained fresh life, and those who had been rich and happy before the war
      declared that they had never experienced a greater feeling of comfort than
      they did then. Just think. We actually had something to eat every day, and
      could sleep every night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the war continued in the east of France, which had been
      excluded from the armistice. Besançon still kept the enemy in check, and
      the latter had their revenge by ravaging the Comte Franché. Sometimes we
      heard that they had approached quite close to the frontier, and we saw
      Swiss troops, who were to form a line of observation between us and the
      Germans, set out on their march.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this hurt our pride, and as we regained health and strength the
      longing for fighting laid hold of us. It was disgraceful and irritating to
      know that within two or three leagues of us the Germans were victorious
      and insolent, to feel that we were protected by our captivity, and to feel
      that on that account we were powerless against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, our captain took five or six of us aside, and spoke to us about
      it, long and earnestly. He was a fine fellow, that captain. He had been a
      sub-lieutenant in the Zouaves, was tall and thin and as hard as steel, and
      during the whole campaign had given a great deal of trouble to the
      Germans. He fretted in inactivity and could not accustom himself to the
      idea of being a prisoner and of doing nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it!&rdquo; he said to us, &ldquo;does it not pain you to know that there are
      a lot of uhlans within two hours of us? Does it not almost drive you mad
      to know that those beggarly wretches are walking about as masters in our
      mountains, where six determined men might kill a whole troop any day? I
      cannot endure it any longer, and I must go there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can you manage it, Captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? It is not very difficult! Just as if we had not done a thing or two
      within the last six months, and got out of woods that were guarded by men
      very different from the Swiss. The day that you wish to cross over into
      France, I will undertake to get you there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be; but what shall we do in France without any arms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without arms? We will get them over yonder, by Jove!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are forgetting the treaty,&rdquo; another soldier said; &ldquo;we shall run the
      risk of doing the Swiss an injury, if Manteuffel learns that they have
      allowed prisoners to return to France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;those are all poor reasons. I mean to go and
      kill some Prussians; that is all I care about. If you do not wish to do as
      I do, well and good; only say so at once. I can quite well go by myself; I
      do not require anybody&rsquo;s company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Naturally we all protested, and as it was quite impossible to make the
      captain alter his mind, we felt obliged to promise to go with him. We
      liked him too much to leave him in the lurch, since he had never failed us
      in any extremity; and so the expedition was decided on.

    <p>
      The captain had a plan of his own, a plan he had been cogitating over for
      some time. A man in that part of the country, whom he knew, was going to
      lend him a cart, and six suits of peasants&rsquo; clothes. We could hide under
      some straw at the bottom of the wagon, which would be loaded with Gruyère
      cheese. This cheese he was supposed to be going to sell in France. The
      captain told the sentinels that he was taking two friends with him to
      protect his goods, in case anyone should try to rob him, which did not
      seem an extraordinary precaution. A Swiss officer seemed to look at the
      wagon in a knowing manner, but that was in order to impress his soldiers.
      In a word, neither officers nor men made it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get on,&rdquo; the captain said to the horses, as he cracked his whip, while
      our men quietly smoked their pipes. I was half suffocated in my box, which
      only admitted the air through some holes in front, while at the same time
      I was nearly frozen, for it was terribly cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get on,&rdquo; the captain said again, and the wagon loaded with Gruyère cheese
      entered France.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prussian lines were very badly guarded, as the enemy trusted to the
      watchfulness of the Swiss. The sergeant spoke North German, while our
      captain spoke the bad German of the &ldquo;Four Cantons&rdquo;; so they could not
      understand each other. The sergeant, however, pretended to be very
      intelligent, and in order to make us believe that he understood us, they
      allowed us to continue our journey, and after traveling for seven hours,
      being continually stopped in the same manner, we arrived at a small
      village of the Jura, in ruins, at nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      What were we going to do? Our only arms were the captain&rsquo;s whip, our
      uniforms, the peasants&rsquo; blouses, and our food the Gruyère cheese. Our sole
      riches consisted in our ammunition, packets of cartridges which we had
      stowed away inside some of the huge cheeses. We had about a thousand of
      them, just two hundred each; but then we wanted rifles, and they must be
      <i>chassepots</i>; luckily, however, the captain was a bold man of an
      inventive mind, and this was the plan that he hit upon:
    </p>
    <p>
      While three of us remained hidden in a cellar in the abandoned village, he
      continued his journey as far as Besançon with the empty wagon and one man.
      The town was invested, but one can always make one&rsquo;s way into a town among
      the hills by crossing the table-land till within about ten miles of the
      walls, and then by following paths and ravines on foot. They left their
      wagon at Omans, among the Germans, and escaped out of it at night on foot,
      so as to gain the heights which border the river Doubs; the next day they
      entered Besançon, where there were plenty of <i>chassepots</i>. There were
      nearly forty thousand of them left in the arsenal, and General Roland, a
      brave marine, laughed at the captain&rsquo;s daring project, but let him have
      six rifles and wished him &ldquo;good luck.&rdquo; There he also found his wife, who
      had been through all the war with us before the campaign in the east, and
      who had been only prevented by illness from continuing with Bourbaki&rsquo;s
      army. She had recovered, however, in spite of the cold, which was growing
      more and more intense, and in spite of the numberless privations that
      awaited her, she insisted on accompanying her husband. He was obliged to
      give way to her, and all three, the captain, his wife, and our comrade,
      started on their expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going was nothing in comparison to returning. They were obliged to travel
      by night, so as to avoid meeting anybody, as the possession of six rifles
      would have made them liable to suspicion. But in spite of everything, a
      week after leaving us, the captain and his &ldquo;two men&rdquo; were back with us
      again. The campaign was about to begin.

    <h2>
      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first night of his arrival, the captain began it himself. Under the
      pretext of examining the country round, he went along the highroad. I must
      tell you that the little village which served as our fortress was a small
      collection of poor, badly built houses, which had been deserted long
      before. It lay on a steep slope, which terminated in a wooded plain. The
      country people sold wood; they sent it down the ravines, which are called
      <i>coulées</i> locally, and which led down to the plain, and there they
      stacked it into piles, which were sold thrice a year to the wood
      merchants. The spot where this market was held was indicated by two small
      houses by the side of the highroad, which served for public-houses. The
      captain had gone down there by one of these <i>coulées</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been gone about half an hour, and we were on the lookout at the top
      of the ravine, when we heard a shot. The captain had ordered us not to
      stir, and only to come to him when we heard him blow his trumpet. It was
      made of a goat&rsquo;s horn, and could be heard a league off, but it gave no
      sound, and in spite of our cruel anxiety, we were obliged to wait in
      silence, with our rifles by our side.
    </p>
    <p>
      To go down these <i>coulées</i> is easy, you need only let yourself glide
      down; but it is more difficult to get up again. You have to scramble up by
      catching hold of the hanging branches of the trees, and sometimes on all
      fours, by sheer strength. A whole mortal hour passed, and still the
      captain did not come, nothing moved in the brushwood. The captain&rsquo;s wife
      began to grow impatient; what could he be doing? Why did he not call us?
      Did the shot that we had heard proceed from an enemy, and had he killed or
      wounded our leader, her husband? They did not know what to think, but I
      myself fancied that either he was dead or that his enterprise was
      successful. I was merely anxious and curious to know which.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, we heard the sound of his trumpet, and were much surprised that
      instead of coming from below, as we had expected, it came from the village
      behind us. What did that mean? It was a mystery to us, but the same idea
      struck us all, that he had been killed, and that the Prussians were
      blowing the trumpet to draw us into an ambush. We therefore returned to
      the cottage, keeping a careful lookout, with our fingers on the trigger
      and hiding under the branches. But his wife, in spite of our entreaties,
      rushed on, leaping like a tigress. She thought that she had to avenge her
      husband, and had fixed the bayonet to her rifle. We lost sight of her at
      the moment that we heard the trumpet again, and a few moments later we
      heard her calling out to us:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on! come on! he is alive! it is he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We hastened on, and saw the captain smoking his pipe at the entrance of
      the village, but strangely enough he was on horseback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he to us, &ldquo;you see that there is something to be done here.
      Here I am on horseback already; I knocked over a uhlan yonder, and took
      his horse; I suppose they were guarding the wood, but it was by drinking
      and swilling in clover. One of them, the sentry at the door, had not time
      to see me before I gave him a sugarplum in his stomach, and then, before
      the others could come out, I jumped on to the horse and was off like a
      shot. Eight or ten of them followed me, I think, but I took the crossroads
      through the wood; I have got scratched and torn a bit, but here I am. And
      now, my good fellows, attention, and take care! Those brigands will not
      rest until they have caught us, and we must receive them with rifle
      bullets. Come along; let us take up our posts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We set out. One of us took up his position a good way from the village of
      the crossroads; I was posted at the entrance of the main street, where the
      road from the level country enters the village, while the two others, with
      the captain and his wife, took up positions in the middle of the village,
      near the church, whose tower served for an observatory and citadel.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had not been in our places long before we heard a shot followed by
      another; then two, then three. The first was evidently a <i>chassepot</i>,&mdash;one
      recognized it by the sharp report, which sounds like the crack of a whip,&mdash;while
      the other three came from the lancers&rsquo; carbines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain was furious. He had given orders to the outpost to let the
      enemy pass, and merely to follow them at a distance if they marched toward
      the village, and to join me when they had gone well between the houses.
      Then they were to appear suddenly, take the patrol between two fires, and
      not allow a single man to escape, for posted as we were, the six of us
      could have hemmed in ten Prussians, if needful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That confounded Piédelot has roused them,&rdquo; the captain said, &ldquo;and they
      will not venture to come on blindfold any longer. And then I am quite sure
      that he has managed to get wounded himself somehow or other, for we hear
      nothing of him. It serves him right; why did he not obey orders?&rdquo; And
      then, after a moment, he grumbled in his beard: &ldquo;After all, I am sorry for
      the poor fellow; he is so brave and shoots so well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain was right in his conjectures. We waited until evening, without
      seeing the uhlans; they had retreated after the first attack, but
      unfortunately we had not seen Piédelot either. Was he dead or a prisoner?
      When night came the captain proposed that we should go out and look for
      him, and so the three of us started. At the crossroads we found a broken
      rifle and some blood, while the ground was trampled down. But we did not
      find either a wounded man or a dead body, although we searched every
      thicket. At midnight we returned without having discovered anything of our
      unfortunate comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very strange,&rdquo; the captain growled. &ldquo;They must have killed him and
      thrown him into the bushes somewhere; they cannot possibly have taken him
      prisoner, as he would have called out for help. I cannot understand it
      all.&rdquo; Just as he said that, bright, red flames shot up in the direction of
      the inn on the highroad, which illuminated the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scoundrels! cowards!&rdquo; shouted the captain. &ldquo;I will bet that they have set
      fire to the two houses in the market-place, in order to have their
      revenge, and then they will scuttle off without saying a word. They will
      be satisfied with having killed a man and setting fire to two houses. All
      right. It shall not pass over like that. We must go for them; they will
      not like to leave their illuminations in order to fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a great stroke of luck if we could set Piédelot free at the
      same time,&rdquo; said some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The five of us set off, full of rage and hope. In twenty minutes we had
      got to the bottom of the <i>couleé</i>, and had not yet seen anyone when
      within a hundred yards of the inn. The fire was behind the house, and so
      all that we saw of it was the reflection above the roof. However, we were
      walking rather slowly, as we were afraid of a trap, when suddenly we heard
      Piédelot&rsquo;s well-known voice. It had a strange sound, however, for it was
      at the same time dull and vibrant, stifled and clear, as if he was calling
      out as loud as he could with a gag in his mouth. He seemed to be hoarse
      and panting, and the unlucky fellow kept exclaiming: &ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We sent all thoughts of prudence to the devil and in two bounds were at
      the back of the inn, where a terrible sight met our eyes.

    <h2>
      IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Piédelot was being burned alive. He was writhing in the middle of a heap
      of fagots, against a stake to which they had fastened him, and the flames
      were licking him with their sharp tongues. When he saw us, his tongue
      seemed to stick in his throat, he drooped his head, and seemed as if he
      were going to die. It was only the affair of a moment to upset the burning
      pile, to scatter the embers, and to cut the ropes that fastened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor fellow! In what a terrible state we found him. The evening before he
      had had his left arm broken, and it seemed as if he had been badly beaten
      since then, for his whole body was covered with wounds, bruises, and
      blood. The flames had also begun their work on him, and he had two large
      burns, one on his loins, and the other on his right thigh, and his beard
      and his hair were scorched. Poor Piédelot!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody knows the terrible rage we felt at this sight! We would have rushed
      headlong at a hundred thousand Prussians. Our thirst for vengeance was
      intense; but the cowards had run away, leaving their crime behind them.
      Where could we find them now? Meanwhile, however, the captain&rsquo;s wife was
      looking after Piédelot, and dressing his wounds as best she could, while
      the captain himself shook hands with him excitedly. In a few minutes he
      came to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Captain, good morning, all of you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ah! the
      scoundrels, the wretches! Why, twenty of them came to surprise us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty, do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there was a whole band of them, and that is why I disobeyed orders,
      Captain, and fired on them, for they would have killed you all. So I
      preferred to stop them. That frightened them, and they did not venture to
      go further than the crossroads. They were such cowards. Four of them shot
      at me at twenty yards, as if I had been a target, and then they slashed me
      with their swords. My arm was broken, so that I could only use my bayonet
      with one hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did you not call for help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took good care not to do that, for you would all have come, and you
      would neither have been able to defend me nor yourselves, being only five
      against twenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that we should not have allowed you to have been taken, poor old
      fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I preferred to die by myself, don&rsquo;t you see! I did not want to bring you
      there, for it would have been a mere ambush.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we will not talk about it any more. Do you feel rather easier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am suffocating. I know that I cannot live much longer. The brutes!
      They tied me to a tree, and beat me till I was half dead, and then they
      shook my broken arm, but I did not make a sound. I would rather have
      bitten my tongue out than have called out before them. Now I can say what
      I am suffering and shed tears; it does one good. Thank you, my kind
      friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Piédelot! But we will avenge you, you may be sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I want you to do that. Especially, there is a woman among them,
      who passes as the wife of the lancer whom the captain killed yesterday.
      She is dressed like a lancer, and it was she who tortured me the most
      yesterday, and suggested burning me. In fact it was she who set fire to
      the wood. Oh! the wretch, the brute&mdash;Ah! how I am suffering! My
      loins, my arms!&rdquo; and he fell back panting and exhausted, writhing in his
      terrible agony, while the captain&rsquo;s wife wiped the perspiration from his
      forehead. We all shed tears of grief and rage, as if we had been children.
      I will not describe the end to you; he died half an hour later, but before
      that he told us in which direction the enemy had gone. When he was dead,
      we gave ourselves time to bury him, and then we set out in pursuit of
      them, with our hearts full of fury and hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will throw ourselves on the whole Prussian army, if it be needful,&rdquo;
       the captain said, &ldquo;but we will avenge Piédelot. We must catch those
      scoundrels. Let us swear to die, rather than not to find them, and if I am
      killed first, these are my orders: all the prisoners that you make are to
      be shot immediately, and as for the lancer&rsquo;s wife, she is to be violated
      before she is put to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must not be shot, because she is a woman,&rdquo; the captain&rsquo;s wife said.
      &ldquo;If you survive, I am sure that you would not shoot a woman. Outraging her
      will be quite sufficient. But if you are killed in this pursuit, I want
      one thing, and that is to fight with her; I will kill her with my own
      hands, and the others can do what they like with her if she kills me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will outrage her! We will burn her! We will tear her to pieces!
      Piédelot shall be avenged, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning we unexpectedly fell on an outpost of uhlans four leagues
      away. Surprised by our sudden attack, they were not able to mount their
      horses, nor even to defend themselves, and in a few moments we had five
      prisoners, corresponding to our own number. The captain questioned them,
      and from their answers we felt certain that they were the same whom we had
      encountered the previous day. Then a very curious operation took place.
      One of us was told off to ascertain their sex, and nothing can depict our
      joy when we discovered what we were seeking among them, the female
      executioner who had tortured our friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four others were shot on the spot, with their backs toward us and
      close to the muzzles of our rifles, and then we turned our attention to
      the woman. What were we going to do with her? I must acknowledge that we
      were all of us in favor of shooting her. Hatred, and the wish to avenge
      Piédelot had extinguished all pity in us, and we had forgotten that we
      were going to shoot a woman. But a woman reminded us of it, the captain&rsquo;s
      wife; at her entreaties, therefore, we determined to keep her a prisoner.
      The captain&rsquo;s poor wife was to be severely punished for this act of
      clemency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day we heard that the armistice had been extended to the eastern
      part of France, and we had to put an end to our little campaign. Two of
      us, who belonged to the neighborhood, returned home. So there remained
      only four of us, all told: the captain, his wife, and two men. We belonged
      to Besançon, which was still being besieged in spite of the armistice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us stop here,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;I cannot believe that the war is
      going to end like this. The devil take it! Surely there are men still left
      in France, and now is the time to prove what they are made of. The spring
      is coming on, and the armistice is only a trap laid for the Prussians.
      During the time that it lasts, a new army will be formed, and some fine
      morning we shall fall upon them again. We shall be ready, and we have a
      hostage&mdash;let us remain here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We fixed our quarters there. It was terribly cold, and we did not go out
      much, as somebody had always to keep the female prisoner in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sullen and never spoke save to refer to her husband, whom the
      captain had killed. She looked at him continually with fierce eyes, and we
      felt that she was tortured by a wild longing for revenge. That seemed to
      us to be the most suitable punishment for the terrible torments that she
      had made Piédelot suffer, for impotent vengeance is such intense pain!
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! we who knew how to avenge our comrade ought to have known that this
      woman would find a way to avenge her husband, and should have been on our
      guard. It is true that one of us kept watch every night, and that at first
      we tied her by a long rope to the great oak bench that was fastened to the
      wall. But, by and by, as she had never tried to escape, in spite of her
      hatred for us, we relaxed our extreme prudence and allowed her to sleep
      somewhere else, and without being tied. What had we to fear? She was at
      the end of the room, a man was on guard at the door, and between her and
      the sentinel the captain&rsquo;s wife and two other men used to lie. She was
      alone and unarmed against four, so there could be no danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night when we were asleep, and the captain was on guard, the lancer&rsquo;s
      wife was lying more quietly in her corner than usual. She had even smiled
      during the evening for the first time since she had been our prisoner.
      Suddenly, however, in the middle of the night, we were awakened by a
      terrible cry. We got up, groping about. Scarcely were we up when we
      stumbled over a furious couple who were rolling about and fighting on the
      ground. It was the captain and the lancer&rsquo;s wife. We threw ourselves on to
      them and separated them in a moment. She was shouting and laughing, and he
      seemed to have the death rattle. All this took place in the dark. Two of
      us held her, and when a light was struck, a terrible sight met our eyes.
      The captain was lying on the floor in a pool of blood, with an enormous
      wound in his throat, and his sword bayonet, that had been taken from his
      rifle, was sticking in the red, gaping wound. A few minutes afterward he
      died, without having been able to utter a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife did not shed a tear. Her eyes were dry, her throat was
      contracted, and she looked at the lancer&rsquo;s wife steadfastly, and with a
      calm ferocity that inspired fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This woman belongs to me,&rdquo; she said to us suddenly. &ldquo;You swore to me not
      a week ago to let me kill her as I chose if she killed my husband, and you
      must keep your oath. You must fasten her securely to the fireplace,
      upright against the back of it, and then you can go where you like, but
      far from here. I will take my revenge on her to myself. Leave the
      captain&rsquo;s body, and we three, he, she, and I, will remain here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We obeyed and went away. She promised to write to us to Geneva, as we were
      returning there.

    <h2>
      VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two days later, I received the following letter, dated the day after we
      had left. It had been written at an inn on the highroad:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Friend:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am writing to you, according to my promise. For the moment I am at this
      inn, where I have just handed my prisoner over to a Prussian officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must tell you, my friend, that this poor woman left two children in
      Germany. She had followed her husband, whom she adored, as she did not
      wish him to be exposed to the risks of war by himself, and as her children
      were with their grandparents. I have learned all this since yesterday, and
      it has turned my ideas of vengeance into more humane feelings. At the very
      moment when I felt pleasure in insulting this woman, and in threatening
      her with the most fearful torments&mdash;in recalling Piédelot, who had
      been burned alive, and in threatening her with a similar death, she looked
      at me coldly, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why should you reproach me, Frenchwoman? You think that you will do
      right in avenging your husband&rsquo;s death, is not that so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Very well then; in killing him, I did what you are going to do in
      burning me. I avenged my husband, for your husband killed him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;as you approve of this vengeance, prepare to endure
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I do not fear it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in fact she did not seem to have lost courage. Her face was calm, and
      she looked at me without trembling, while I brought wood and dried leaves
      together, and feverishly threw on to them the powder from some cartridges,
      to make her funeral pile the more cruel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hesitated in my thoughts of persecution for a moment. But the captain&rsquo;s
      body was there, pale and covered with blood, and he seemed to be looking
      at me with large, glassy eyes, and I applied myself to my work again after
      kissing his pale lips. Suddenly, however, on raising my head, I saw that
      she was crying, and I felt rather surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;So you are frightened?&rsquo; I said to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No, but when I saw you kiss your husband, I thought of mine, of all whom
      I love.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She continued to sob, but stopping suddenly she said to me in broken
      words, and in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Have you any children?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A shiver ran over me, for I guessed that this poor woman had some. She
      asked me to look in a pocketbook which was in her bosom, and in it I saw
      two photographs of quite young children, a boy and a girl, with those
      kind, gentle, chubby faces that German children have. In it there were
      also two locks of light hair and a letter in a large childish hand,
      beginning with German words which meant: &lsquo;My dear little mother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not restrain my tears, my dear friend, and so I untied her, and
      without venturing to look at the face of my poor, dead husband, who was
      not to be avenged, I went with her as far as the inn. She is free; I have
      just left her, and she kissed me with tears. I am going upstairs to my
      husband; come as soon as possible, my dear friend, to look for our two
      bodies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I set off with all speed, and when I arrived there was a Prussian patrol
      at the cottage. When I asked what it all meant, I was told that there was
      a captain of <i>francs-tireurs</i> and his wife inside, both dead. I gave
      their names; they saw that I knew them, and I begged to be allowed to
      undertake their funeral.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody has already undertaken it,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Go in if you wish
      to, as you knew them. You can settle about their funeral with their
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went in. The captain and his wife were lying side by side on a bed, and
      were covered by a sheet. I raised it, and saw that the woman had inflicted
      a wound in her throat similar to that from which her husband had died.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the side of the bed there sat, watching and weeping, the woman who had
      been mentioned to me as their last friend. It was the lancer&rsquo;s wife.

      In front of the building, half farmhouse, half manor-house, one of those
      rural habitations of a mixed character which were all but seigneurial, and
      which are at the present time occupied by large cultivators, the dogs,
      lashed beside the apple-trees in the orchard near the house, kept barking

      and the boys. In the spacious dining-room kitchen, Hautot Senior and
      Hautot Junior, M. Bermont, the tax-collector, and M. Mondaru, the notary,
      were taking a bite and drinking some wine before going out to shoot, for
      it was the opening day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hautot Senior, proud of all his possessions, talked boastfully beforehand
      of the game which his guests were going to find on his lands. He was a big
      Norman, one of those powerful, ruddy, bony men, who can lift wagonloads of
      apples on their shoulders. Half peasant, half gentleman, rich, respected,
      influential, invested with authority, he made his son César go as far as
      the third form at school, so that he might be an educated man, and there
      he had brought his studies to a stop for fear of his becoming a fine
      gentleman and paying no attention to the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      César Hautot, almost as tall as his father, but thinner, was a good son,
      docile, content with everything, full of admiration, respect, and
      deference for the wishes and opinions of his sire.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Bermont, the tax-collector, a stout little man, who showed on his red
      cheeks a thin network of violet veins resembling the tributaries and the
      winding courses of rivers on maps, asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And hares&mdash;are there any hares on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hautot Senior answered: &ldquo;As many as you like, especially in the Puysatier
      lands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which direction shall we begin in?&rdquo; asked the notary, a jolly notary, fat
      and pale, big-paunched too, and strapped up in an entirely new hunting
      costume bought at Rouen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that way, through these grounds. We will drive the partridges into
      the plain, and we will beat there again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Hautot Senior rose up. They all followed his example, took their guns
      out of the corners, examined the locks, stamped with their feet in order
      to feel themselves firmer in their boots which were rather hard, not
      having as yet been rendered flexible by the heat of the blood. Then they
      went out; and the dogs, standing erect at the ends of their leashes, gave
      vent to piercing howls while beating the air with their paws.
    </p>
    <p>
      They set forth for the lands referred to. These consisted of a little
      glen, or rather a long undulating stretch of inferior soil, which had on
      that account remained uncultivated, furrowed with mountain-torrents,
      covered with ferns, an excellent preserve for game.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sportsmen took up their positions at some distance from each other,
      Hautot Senior posting himself at the right, Hautot Junior at the left, and
      the two guests in the middle. The keeper and those who carried the
      game-bags followed. It was the anxious moment when the first shot is
      awaited, when the heart beats a little, while the nervous finger keeps
      feeling at the trigger every second.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the shot went off. Hautot Senior had fired. They all stopped, and
      saw a partridge breaking off from a covey which was rushing along at great
      speed to fall down into a ravine under a thick growth of brushwood. The
      sportsman, becoming excited, rushed forward with rapid strides, thrusting
      aside the briers which stood in his path, and disappeared in his turn into
      the thicket in quest of his game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost at the same instant, a second shot was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! the rascal!&rdquo; exclaimed M. Bermont, &ldquo;he will unearth a hare down
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all waited, with their eyes riveted on the heap of branches through
      which their gaze failed to penetrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notary, making a speaking-trumpet of his hands, shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hautot Senior made no response.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then César, turning toward the keeper, said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just go and assist him, Joseph. We must keep walking in a straight line.
      We&rsquo;ll wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Joseph, an old stump of a man, lean and knotty, all of whose joints
      formed protuberances, proceeded at an easy pace down the ravine, searching
      at every opening through which a passage could be effected with the
      cautiousness of a fox. Then, suddenly, he cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! come! come! an unfortunate thing has occurred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all hurried forward, plunging through the briers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder Hautot, who had fallen on his side, in a fainting condition,
      kept both his hands over his stomach, from which flowed down upon the
      grass through the linen vest torn by the lead, long streamlets of blood.
      As he was laying down his gun, in order to seize the partridge within
      reach of him, he had let the firearm fall, and the second discharge, going
      off with the shock, had torn open his entrails. They drew him out of the
      trench; they removed his clothes and they saw a frightful wound, through
      which the intestines came out. Then, after having bandaged him the best
      way they could, they brought him back to his own house, and awaited the
      doctor, who had been sent for, as well as a priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the doctor arrived, he gravely shook his head, and, turning toward
      young Hautot, who was sobbing on a chair:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor boy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this does not look well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, when the dressing was finished, the wounded man moved his fingers,
      opened his mouth, then his eyes, cast around him troubled, haggard
      glances, then appeared to search about in his memory, to recollect, to
      understand, and he murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! good God! this has done for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor held his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why no, why no, some days of rest merely&mdash;it will be nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hautot returned:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has done for me! My stomach is split open! I know it well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, all of a sudden:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to talk to the son, if I have the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hautot Junior, in spite of himself, shed tears, and kept repeating like a
      little boy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P&rsquo;pa, p&rsquo;pa, poor p&rsquo;pa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the father, in a firmer tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! stop crying&mdash;this is not the time for it. I have to talk to
      you. Sit down there quite close to me. It will be quickly done, and I
      shall be more calm. As for the rest of you, kindly give me one minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all went out, leaving the father and son face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they were alone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, son! you are twenty-four years; one can say things like this to
      you. And then there is not such mystery about these matters as we import
      into them. You know well that your mother has been seven years dead, isn&rsquo;t
      that so? and that I am not more than forty-five years myself, seeing that
      I got married at nineteen? Is not that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The son faltered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So then your mother has been seven years dead, and I have remained a
      widower. Well! a man like me cannot remain without a wife at thirty-eight,
      isn&rsquo;t that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The son replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father, out of breath, quite pale, and his face contracted with
      suffering, went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God! what pain I feel! Well, you understand. Man is not made to live
      alone, but I did not want to take a successor to your mother, since I
      promised her not to do so. Then&mdash;you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, I kept a young girl at Rouen, Rue d&rsquo;Eperlan 18, in the third story,
      the second door,&mdash;I tell you all this, don&rsquo;t forget,&mdash;but a
      young girl, who has been very nice to me, loving, devoted, a true woman,
      eh? You comprehend, my lad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So then, if I am carried off, I owe something to her, something
      substantial, that will place her in a safe position. You understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you that she is an honest girl, and that, but for you, and the
      remembrance of your mother, and again but for the house in which we three
      lived, I would have brought her here, and then married her, for certain&mdash;listen&mdash;listen,
      my lad. I might have made a will&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t done so. I did not wish
      to do so&mdash;for it is not necessary to write down things&mdash;things
      of this sort&mdash;it is too hurtful to the legitimate children&mdash;and
      then it embroils everything&mdash;it ruins everyone! Look you, the stamped
      paper, there&rsquo;s no need of it&mdash;never make use of it. If I am rich, it
      is because I have not made waste of what I have during my own life. You
      understand, my son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen again&mdash;listen well to me! So then, I have made no will&mdash;I
      did not desire to do so&mdash;and then I knew what you were; you have a
      good heart; you are not niggardly, not too near, in any way; I said to
      myself that when my end approached I would tell you all about it, and that
      I would beg of you not to forget the girl. And then listen again! When I
      am gone, make your way to the place at once&mdash;and make such
      arrangements that she may not blame my memory. You have plenty of means. I
      leave it to you&mdash;I leave you enough. Listen! You won&rsquo;t find her at
      home every day in the week. She works at Madame Moreau&rsquo;s in the Rue
      Beauvoisine. Go there on a Thursday. That is the day she expects me. It
      has been my day for the past six years. Poor little thing! she will weep!&mdash;I
      say all this to you because I have known you so well, my son. One does not
      tell these things in public either to the notary or to the priest. They
      happen&mdash;everyone knows that&mdash;but they are not talked about, save
      in case of necessity. Then there is no outsider in the secret, nobody
      except the family, because the family consists of one person alone. You
      understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you swear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg of you, I implore of you, so do not forget. I bind you to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will go yourself. I want you to make sure of everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, then, you will see&mdash;you will see what she will explain to you.
      As for me, I can say no more to you. You have vowed to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, my son. Embrace me. Farewell. I am going to break up, I&rsquo;m
      sure. Tell them they may come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Hautot embraced his father, groaning while he did so; then, always
      docile, he opened the door, and the priest appeared in a white surplice,
      carrying the holy oils.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the dying man had closed his eyes and he refused to open them again,
      he refused to answer, he refused to show, even by a sign, that he
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had spoken enough, this man; he could speak no more. Besides he now
      felt his heart calm; he wanted to die in peace. What need had he to make a
      confession to the deputy of God, since he had just done so to his son, who
      constituted his own family?
    </p>
    <p>
      He received the last rites, was purified and absolved, in the midst of his
      friends and his servants on their bended knees, without any movement of
      his face indicating that he still lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      He expired about midnight, after four hours&rsquo; convulsive movements, which
      showed that he must have suffered dreadfully in his last moments.

    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was on the following Tuesday that they buried him; the shooting had
      opened on Sunday. On his return home, after having accompanied his father
      to the cemetery, César Hautot spent the rest of the day weeping. He
      scarcely slept at all on the following night, and he felt so sad on
      awakening that he asked himself how he could go on living.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he kept thinking until evening that, in order to obey the last
      wish of his father, he ought to repair to Rouen next day, and see this
      girl Catholine Donet, who resided in the Rue d&rsquo;Eperlan in the third story,
      second door. He had repeated to himself in a whisper, just as a little boy
      repeats a prayer, this name and address a countless number of times, so
      that he might not forget them, and he ended by lisping them continually,
      without being able to stop or to think of what they were, so much were his
      tongue and his mind possessed by the commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, on the following day, about eight o&rsquo;clock, he ordered
      Graindorge to be yoked to the tilbury, and set forth at the quick trotting
      pace of the heavy Norman horse, along the highroad from Ainville to Rouen.
      He wore his black frock-coat, a tall silk hat on his head, and breeches
      with straps; and he did not, on account of the occasion, dispense with the
      handsome costume, the blue overalls which swelled in the wind, protecting
      the cloth from dust and from stains, and which was to be removed quickly
      the moment he jumped out of the coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered Rouen accordingly just as it was striking ten o&rsquo;clock, drew up,
      as he had usually done, at the Hôtel des Bon-Enfants, in the Rue des
      Trois-Marcs, submitted to the hugs of the landlord and his wife and their
      five children, for they had heard the melancholy news. After that, he had
      to tell them all the particulars about the accident, which caused him to
      shed tears, to repel all the proffered attentions which they sought to
      thrust upon him merely because he was wealthy, and to decline even the
      breakfast they wanted him to partake of, thus wounding their
      sensibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, having wiped the dust off his hat, brushed his coat and removed the
      mud stains from his boots, he set forth in search of the Rue d&rsquo;Eperlan,
      without venturing to make inquiries from anyone, for fear of being
      recognized and arousing suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, being unable to find the place, he saw a priest passing by,
      and, trusting to the professional discretion which churchmen possess, he
      questioned the ecclesiastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had only a hundred steps farther to go; it was exactly the second
      street to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he hesitated. Up to that moment, he had obeyed, like a mere animal,
      the expressed wish of the deceased. Now he felt quite agitated, confused,
      humiliated, at the idea of finding himself&mdash;the son&mdash;in the
      presence of this woman who had been his father&rsquo;s mistress. All the
      morality which lies buried in our breasts, heaped up at the bottom of our
      sensuous emotions by centuries of hereditary instruction, all that he had
      been taught, since he had learned his catechism, about creatures of evil
      life, the instinctive contempt which every man entertains for them, even
      though he may marry one of them, all the narrow honesty of the peasant in
      his character, was stirred up within him and held him back, making him
      grow red with shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he said to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promised the father, I must not break my promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he gave a push to the door of the house bearing the number 18, which
      stood ajar, discovered a gloomy-looking staircase, ascended three flights,
      perceived a door, then a second door, came upon the string of a bell, and
      pulled it. The ringing, which resounded in the apartment before which he
      stood, sent a shiver through his frame. The door was opened, and he found
      himself facing a young lady very well dressed, a brunette with a fresh
      complexion, who gazed at him with eyes of astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not know what to say to her, and she, who suspected nothing, and
      who was waiting for him to speak, did not invite him to come in. They
      stood looking thus at one another for nearly half a minute, at the end of
      which she said in a questioning tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have something to tell me, Monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He falteringly replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am M. Hautot&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave a start, turned pale, and stammered out as if she had known him
      for a long time:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur César?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to speak to you on the part of my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She articulated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then drew back so that he might enter. He shut the door and followed
      her into the interior. Then he saw a little boy of four or five years
      playing with a cat, seated on the floor in front of a stove, from which
      rose the steam of dishes which were being kept hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a seat,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He no longer ventured to speak, keeping his eyes fixed on the table which
      stood in the center of the room, with three covers laid on it, one of
      which was for a child. He glanced at the chair which had its back turned
      to the fire. They had been expecting him. That was his bread which he saw,
      and which he recognized near the fork, for the crust had been removed on
      account of Hautot&rsquo;s bad teeth. Then, raising his eyes, he noticed on the
      wall his father&rsquo;s portrait, the large photograph taken at Paris the year
      of the exhibition, the same as that which hung above the bed in the
      sleeping apartment at Ainville.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman again asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Monsieur César?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kept staring at her. Her face was livid with anguish; and she waited,
      her hands trembling with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he took courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mam&rsquo;zelle, papa died on Sunday last just after he had opened the
      shooting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was so much overwhelmed that she did not move. After a silence of a
      few seconds, she faltered in an almost inaudible tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is not possible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, on a sudden, tears showed themselves in her eyes, and covering her
      face with her hands, she burst out sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that point the little boy turned round, and, seeing his mother weeping,
      began to howl. Then, realizing that this sudden trouble was brought about
      by the stranger, he rushed at César, caught hold of his breeches with one
      hand and with the other hit him with all his strength on the thigh. And
      César remained agitated, deeply affected, with this woman mourning for his
      father at one side of him, and the little boy defending his mother at the
      other. He felt their emotion taking possession of himself, and his eyes
      were beginning to brim over with the same sorrow; so, to recover his
      self-command, he began to talk:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the accident occurred on Sunday, at eight o&rsquo;clock&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he told, as if she were listening to him, all the facts without
      forgetting a single detail, mentioning the most trivial matters with the
      minuteness of a countryman. And the child still kept assailing him, making
      kicks at his ankles.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came to the time at which his father had spoken about her, her
      attention was caught by hearing her own name, and, uncovering her face,
      she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me! I was not following you; I would like to know&mdash;if you do
      not mind beginning over again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He related everything at great length, with stoppages, breaks, and
      reflections of his own from time to time. She listened to him eagerly now
      perceiving with a woman&rsquo;s keen sensibility all the sudden changes of
      fortune which his narrative indicated, and trembling with horror, every
      now and then, exclaiming:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little fellow, believing that she had calmed down, ceased beating
      César, in order to catch his mother&rsquo;s hand, and he listened, too, as if he
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the narrative was finished, young Hautot continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, we will settle matters together in accordance with his wishes.
      Listen: I am well off, he has left me plenty of means. I don&rsquo;t want you to
      have anything to complain about&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she quickly interrupted him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Monsieur César, Monsieur César, not today. I am cut to the heart&mdash;another
      time&mdash;another day. No, not to-day. If I accept, listen! &lsquo;Tis not for
      myself&mdash;no, no, no, I swear to you. &lsquo;Tis for the child. Besides this
      provision will be put to his account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon César scared, divined the truth, and stammering:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So then&mdash;&lsquo;tis his&mdash;the child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Hautot Junior gazed at his brother with a confused emotion, intense
      and painful.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a lengthened silence, for she had begun to weep afresh, César, quite
      embarrassed, went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, Mam&rsquo;zelle Donet, I am going. When would you wish to talk this
      over with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, don&rsquo;t go! don&rsquo;t go! Don&rsquo;t leave me all alone with Emile. I would
      die of grief. I have no longer anyone, anyone but my child. Oh! what
      wretchedness, what wretchedness. Monsieur César! Stop! Sit down again. You
      will say something more to me. You will tell me what he was doing over
      there all the week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And César resumed his seat, accustomed to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew over another chair for herself in front of the stove, where the
      dishes had all this time been simmering, took Emile upon her knees, and
      asked César a thousand questions about his father with reference to
      matters of an intimate nature, which made him feel, without reasoning on
      the subject, that she had loved Hautot with all the strength of her frail
      woman&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, by the natural concatenation of his ideas&mdash;which were rather
      limited in number&mdash;he recurred once more to the accident, and set
      about telling the story over again with all the same details.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he said: &ldquo;He had a hole in his stomach&mdash;you could put your two
      fists into it,&rdquo; she gave vent to a sort of shriek, and the tears gushed
      forth again from her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, seized by the contagion of her grief, César began to weep, too, and
      as tears always soften the fibers of the heart, he bent over Emile whose
      forehead was close to his own mouth and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother, recovering her breath, murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor lad, he is an orphan now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so am I,&rdquo; said César.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they ceased to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly the practical instinct of the housewife, accustomed to be
      thoughtful about many things, revived in the young woman&rsquo;s breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have perhaps taken nothing all the morning, Monsieur César.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mam&rsquo;zelle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you must be hungry. You will eat a morsel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am not hungry; I have had too much trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spite of sorrow, we must live. You will not refuse to let me get
      something for you! And then you will remain a little longer. When you are
      gone I don&rsquo;t know what will become of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He yielded after some further resistance, and, sitting down with his back
      to the fire, facing her, he ate a plateful of tripe, which had been
      bubbling in the stove, and drank a glass of red wine. But he would not
      allow her to uncork the bottle of white wine. He several times wiped the
      mouth of the little boy, who had smeared all his chin with sauce.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was rising up to go, he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When would you like me to come back to speak about this business to you,
      Mam&rsquo;zelle Donet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is all the same to you, say next Thursday, Monsieur César. In that
      way I would lose none of my time, as I always have my Thursdays free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will suit me&mdash;next Thursday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come to lunch. Won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! On that point I can&rsquo;t give you a promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reason I suggested it is that people can chat better when they are
      eating. One has more time, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, be it so. About twelve o&rsquo;clock, then.&rdquo; And he took his departure,
      after he had again kissed little Emile, and pressed Mademoiselle Donet&rsquo;s
      hand.

    <h2>
      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The week appeared long to César Hautot. He had never before found himself
      alone, and the isolation seemed to him insupportable. Till now, he had
      lived at his father&rsquo;s side, just like his shadow, followed him into the
      fields, superintended the execution of his orders, and, when they had been
      a short time separated, again met him at dinner. They had spent the
      evenings smoking their pipes, face to face with one another, chatting
      about horses, cows, or sheep, and the grip of their hands when they rose
      up in the morning might have been regarded as a manifestation of deep
      family affection on both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now César was alone, he went vacantly through the process of dressing the
      soil in autumn, every moment expecting to see the tall gesticulating
      silhouette of his father rising up at the end of a plain. To kill time, he
      entered the houses of his neighbors, told about the accident to all who
      had not heard of it, and sometimes repeated it to the others. Then, after
      he had finished his occupations and his reflections, he would sit down at
      the side of the road, asking himself whether this kind of life was going
      to last forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      He frequently thought of Mademoiselle Donet. He liked her. He considered
      her thoroughly respectable, a gentle and honest young woman, as his father
      had said. Yes, undoubtedly she was an honest girl. He resolved to act
      handsomely toward her, and to give her two thousand francs a year,
      settling the capital on the child. He even experienced a certain pleasure
      in thinking that he was going to see her on the following Thursday and
      arrange this matter with her. And then the notion of this brother, this
      little chap of five, who was his father&rsquo;s son, plagued him, annoyed him a
      little, and at the same time, excited him. He had, as it were, a family in
      this brat, sprung from a clandestine alliance, who would never bear the
      name of Hautot, a family which he might take or leave, just as he pleased,
      but which would recall his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, when he saw himself on the road to Rouen on Thursday morning,
      carried along by Graindorge trotting with clattering foot-beats, he felt
      his heart lighter, more at peace than he had hitherto felt it since his
      bereavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering Mademoiselle Donet&rsquo;s apartment, he saw the table laid as on
      the previous Thursday, with the sole difference that the crust had not
      been removed from the bread. He pressed the young woman&rsquo;s hand, kissed
      Emile on the cheeks, and sat down, more or less as if he were in his own
      house, his heart swelling in the same way. Mademoiselle Donet seemed to
      him a little thinner and paler. She must have grieved sorely. She wore now
      an air of constraint in his presence, as if she understood what she had
      not felt the week before under the first blow of her misfortune, and she
      exhibited an excessive deference toward him, a mournful humility, and made
      touching efforts to please him, as if to pay him back by her attentions
      for the kindness he had manifested toward her. They were a long time at
      lunch talking over the business which had brought him there. She did not
      want so much money. It was too much. She earned enough to live on herself,
      but she only wished that Emile might find a few sous awaiting him when he
      grew big. César held out, however, and even added a gift of a thousand
      francs for herself for the expense of mourning.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had taken his coffee, she asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you smoke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I have my pipe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt in his pocket. Good God! He had forgotten it! He was becoming
      quite woe-begone about it when she offered him a pipe of his father&rsquo;s that
      had been shut up in a cupboard. He accepted it, took it up in his hand,
      recognized it, smelled it, spoke of its quality in a tone of emotion,
      filled it with tobacco, and lighted it. Then he set Emile astride on his
      knee, and made him play the cavalier, while she removed the tablecloth and
      put the soiled plates at one end of the sideboard in order to wash them as
      soon as he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      About three o&rsquo;clock, he rose up with regret, quite annoyed at the thought
      of having to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! Mademoiselle Donet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I wish you good evening, and am
      delighted to have found you like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She remained standing before him, blushing, much affected, and gazed at
      him while she thought of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we not see one another again?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied simply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, Mam&rsquo;zelle, if it gives you pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Monsieur César. Will next Thursday suit you then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mademoiselle Donet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come to lunch, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;if you are so kind as to invite me, I can&rsquo;t refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is understood, then, Monsieur César&mdash;next Thursday, at twelve,
      the same as to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thursday at twelve, Mam&rsquo;zelle Donet!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      NO QUARTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      The broad sunlight threw its burning rays on the fields, and under this
      shower of flame life burst forth in glowing vegetation from the earth. As
      far as the eye could see, the soil was green; and the sky was blue to the
      verge of the horizon. The Norman farms scattered through the plain seemed
      at a distance like little woods inclosed each in a circle of thin
      beech-trees. Coming closer, on opening the worm-eaten stile, one fancied
      that he saw a giant garden, for all the old apple-trees, as knotted as the
      peasants, were in blossom. The weather-beaten black trunks, crooked,
      twisted, ranged along the inclosure, displayed beneath the sky their
      glittering domes, rosy and white. The sweet perfume of their blossoms
      mingled with the heavy odors of the open stables and with the fumes of the
      steaming dunghill, covered with hens and their chickens. It was midday.
      The family sat at dinner in the shadow of the pear-tree planted before the
      door&mdash;the father, the mother, the four children, the two
      maidservants, and the three farm laborers. They scarcely uttered a word.
      Their fare consisted of soup and of a stew composed of potatoes mashed up
      in lard.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time one of the maidservants rose up, and went to the cellar
      to fetch a pitcher of cider.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband, a big fellow of about forty, stared at a vine-tree, quite
      exposed to view, which stood close to the farmhouse, twining like a
      serpent under the shutters the entire length of the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said, after a long silence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The father&rsquo;s vine-tree is blossoming early this year. Perhaps it will
      bear good fruit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The peasant&rsquo;s wife also turned round, and gazed at the tree without
      speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      This vine-tree was planted exactly in the place where the father of the
      peasant had been shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during the war of 1870. The Prussians were in occupation of the
      entire country. General Faidherbe, with the Army of the North, was at
      their head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the Prussian staff had taken up its quarters in this farmhouse. The
      old peasant who owned it, Père Milon, received them, and gave them the
      best treatment he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a whole month the German vanguard remained on the lookout in the
      village. The French were posted ten leagues away without moving, and yet,
      each night, some of the uhlans disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the isolated scouts, those who were sent out on patrol, whenever they
      started in groups of two or three, never came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were picked up dead in the morning in a field, near a farmyard, in a
      ditch. Their horses even were found lying on the roads with their throats
      cut by a saber stroke. These murders seemed to have been accomplished by
      the same men, who could not be discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The country was terrorized. Peasants were shot on mere information, women
      were imprisoned, attempts were made to obtain revelations from children by
      fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, one morning, Père Milon was found stretched in his stable with a gash
      across his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two uhlans ripped open were seen lying three kilometers away from the
      farmhouse. One of them still grasped in his hand his blood-stained weapon.
      He had fought and defended himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A council of war having been immediately constituted, in the open air, in
      front of the farmhouse, the old man was brought before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sixty-eight years old. He was small, thin, a little crooked, with
      long hands resembling the claws of a crab. His faded hair, scanty and
      slight, like the down on a young duck, allowed his scalp to be plainly
      seen. The brown, crimpled skin of his neck showed the big veins which sank
      under his jaws and reappeared at his temples. He was regarded in the
      district as a miser and a hard man in business transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was placed standing between four soldiers in front of the kitchen
      table, which had been carried out of the house for the purpose. Five
      officers and the Colonel sat facing him. The Colonel was the first to
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Père Milon,&rdquo; he said, in French, &ldquo;since we came here we have had nothing
      to say of you but praise. You have always been obliging, and even
      considerate toward us. But to-day a terrible accusation rests on you, and
      the matter must be cleared up. How did you get the wound on your face?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The peasant gave no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your silence condemns you, Père Milon. But I want you to answer me, do
      you understand? Do you know who has killed the two uhlans who were found
      this morning near the crossroads?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man said in a clear voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was I!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel, surprised, remained silent for a second, looking steadfully
      at the prisoner. Père Milon maintained his impassive demeanor, his air of
      rustic stupidity, with downcast eyes, as if he were talking to his cure.
      There was only one thing that could reveal his internal agitation, the way
      in which he slowly swallowed his saliva with a visible effort, as if he
      were choking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old peasant&rsquo;s family&mdash;his son Jean, his daughter-in-law, and two
      little children stood ten paces behind, scared and dismayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know also who killed all the scouts of our army whom we have found
      every morning, for the past month, lying here and there in the fields?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man answered with the same brutal impassiveness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was I!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is you, then, that killed them all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of them-yes, it was I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me the way you managed to do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time the peasant appeared to be affected; the necessity of speaking
      at some length incommoded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know myself. I did it the way I found easiest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I warn you, you must tell me everything. You will do well, therefore, to
      make up your mind about it at once. How did you begin it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The peasant cast an uneasy glance toward his family, who remained in a
      listening attitude behind him. He hesitated for another second or so, then
      all of a sudden he came to a resolution on the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came home one night about ten o&rsquo;clock, and the next day you were here.
      You and your soldiers gave me fifty crowns for forage with a cow and two
      sheep. Said I to myself: &lsquo;As long as I get twenty crowns out of them, I&rsquo;ll
      sell them the value of it.&rsquo; But then I had other things in my heart, which
      I&rsquo;ll tell you about now. I came across one of your cavalrymen smoking his
      pipe near my dike, just behind my barn. I went and took my scythe off the
      hook, and I came back with short steps from behind, while he lay there
      without hearing anything. And I cut off his head with one stroke, like a
      feather, while he only said &lsquo;Oof!&rsquo; You have only to look at the bottom of
      the pond; you&rsquo;ll find him there in a coal bag with a big stone tied to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got an idea into my head. I took all he had on him from his boots to
      his cap, and I hid them in the bakehouse in the Martin wood behind the
      farmyard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man stopped. The officers, speechless, looked at one another. The
      examination was resumed, and this is what they were told.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he had accomplished this murder, the peasant lived with only one
      thought: &ldquo;To kill the Prussians!&rdquo; He hated them with the sly and ferocious
      hatred of a countryman who was at the same time covetous and patriotic. He
      had got an idea into his head, as he put it. He waited for a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was allowed to go and come freely, to go out and return just as he
      pleased, as long as he displayed humility, submissiveness, and
      complaisance toward the conquerors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, every evening he saw the cavalrymen bearing dispatches leaving the
      farmhouse; and he went out, one night, after discovering the name of the
      village to which they were going, and after picking up by associating with
      the soldiers the few words of German he needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made his way through his farmyard, slipped into the wood, reached the
      bakehouse, penetrated to the end of the long passage, and having found the
      clothes of the soldier which he had hidden there, he put them on. Then he
      went prowling about the fields, creeping along, keeping to the slopes so
      as to avoid observation, listening to the least sounds, restless as a
      poacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he believed the time had arrived he took up his position at the
      roadside, and hid himself in a clump of brushwood. He still waited. At
      length, near midnight, he heard the galloping of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs on the
      hard soil of the road. The old man put his ear to the ground to make sure
      that only one cavalryman was approaching; then he got ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      The uhlan came on at a very quick pace, carrying some dispatches. He rode
      forward with watchful eyes and strained ears. As soon as he was no more
      than ten paces away, Père Milon dragged himself across the road, groaning:
      &ldquo;Hilfe! hilfe!&rdquo; (&ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo;).
    </p>
    <p>
      The cavalryman drew up, recognized a German soldier dismounted, believed
      that he was wounded, leaped down from his horse, drew near the prostrate
      man, never suspecting anything, and, as he stooped over the stranger, he
      received in the middle of the stomach the long, curved blade of the saber.
      He sank down without any death throes, merely quivering with a few last
      shudders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Norman, radiant with the mute joy of an old peasant, rose up, and
      merely to please himself, cut the dead soldier&rsquo;s throat. After that, he
      dragged the corpse to the dike and threw it in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse was quietly waiting for its rider, Père Milon got on the saddle
      and started across the plain at the gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of an hour, he perceived two more uhlans approaching the
      staff-quarters side by side. He rode straight toward them, crying: &ldquo;Hilfe!
      hilfe!&rdquo; The Prussians let him come on, recognizing the uniform without any
      distrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      And like a cannon ball the old man shot between the two, bringing both of
      them to the ground with his saber and a revolver. The next thing he did
      was to cut the throats of the horses&mdash;the German horses! Then, softly
      he re-entered the bakehouse and hid the horse he had ridden himself in the
      dark passage. There he took off the uniform, put on once more his own old
      clothes, and going to his bed, slept till morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      For four days, he did not stir out, awaiting the close of the open inquiry
      as to the cause of the soldiers&rsquo; deaths; but, on the fifth day, he started
      out again, and by a similar stratagem killed two more soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thenceforth, he never stopped. Each night he wandered about, prowled
      through the country at random, cutting down some Prussians, sometimes
      here, sometimes there, galloping through the deserted fields under the
      moonlight, a lost uhlan, a hunter of men. Then, when he had finished his
      task, leaving behind him corpses lying along the roads, the old horseman
      went to the bakehouse where he concealed both the animal and the uniform.
      About midday he calmly returned to the spot to give the horse a feed of
      oats and some water, and he took every care of the animal, exacting
      therefore the hardest work.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, the night before his arrest, one of the soldiers he attacked put
      himself on his guard, and cut the old peasant&rsquo;s face with a slash of a
      saber.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, however, killed both of them. He had even managed to go back and
      hide his horse and put on his everyday garb, but, when he reached the
      stable, he was overcome by weakness and was not able to make his way into
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been found lying on the straw, his face covered with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished his story, he suddenly lifted his head and glanced
      proudly at the Prussian officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel, tugging at his mustache, asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you anything more to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nothing more; we are quits. I killed sixteen, not one more, not one
      less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know you have to die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask for no quarter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been a soldier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I served at one time. And &lsquo;tis you killed my father, who was a
      soldier of the first Emperor, not to speak of my youngest son François,
      whom you killed last month near Evreux. I owed this to you, and I&rsquo;ve paid
      you back. &lsquo;Tis tit for tat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officers stared at one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight for my father, eight for my son&mdash;that pays it off! I sought
      for no quarrel with you. I don&rsquo;t know you! I only know where you came
      from. You came to my house here and ordered me about as if the house was
      yours. I have had my revenge, and I&rsquo;m glad of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And stiffening up his old frame, he folded his arms in the attitude of a
      humble hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prussians held a long conference. A captain, who had also lost a son
      the month before defended the brave old farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Colonel rose up, and, advancing toward Père Milon, he said,
      lowering his voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, old man! There is perhaps one way of saving your life&mdash;it is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the old peasant was not listening to him, and, fixing his eyes
      directly on the German officer, while the wind made the scanty hair move
      to and fro on his skull, he made a frightful grimace, which shriveled up
      his pinched countenance scarred by the saber-stroke, and, puffing out his
      chest, he spat, with all his strength, right into the Prussian&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel, stupefied, raised his hand, and for the second time the
      peasant spat in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the officers sprang to their feet and yelled out orders at the same
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less than a minute the old man, still as impassive as ever, was stuck
      up against the wall and shot, while he cast a smile at Jean, his eldest
      son, and then at his daughter-in-law and the two children, who were
      staring with terror at the scene.

    <h2>
      THE ORPHAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Source had adopted this boy under very sad circumstances. She
      was at the time thirty-six years old. She was disfigured, having in her
      infancy slipped off her nurse&rsquo;s lap into the fireplace, and getting her
      face so shockingly burned that it ever afterward presented a frightful
      appearance. This deformity had made her resolve not to marry, for she did
      not want any man to marry her for her money.
    </p>
    <p>
      A female neighbor of hers, being left a widow during her pregnancy, died
      in childbirth, without leaving a sou. Mademoiselle Source took the newborn
      child, put him out to nurse, reared him, sent him to a boarding-school,
      then brought him home in his fourteenth year, in order to have in her
      empty house somebody who would love her, who would look after her, who
      would make her old age pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      She resided on a little property four leagues away from Rennes, and she
      now dispensed with a servant. The expenses having increased to more than
      double what they had been since this orphan&rsquo;s arrival, her income of three
      thousand francs was no longer sufficient to support three persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      She attended to the housekeeping and the cooking herself, and sent the boy
      out on errands, letting him further occupy himself with cultivating the
      garden. He was gentle, timid, silent, and caressing. And she experienced a
      deep joy, a fresh joy at being embraced by him, without any apparent
      surprise or repugnance being exhibited by him on account of her ugliness.
      He called her &ldquo;Aunt&rdquo; and treated her as a mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening they both sat down at the fireside, and she got nice things
      ready for him. She heated some wine and toasted a slice of bread, and it
      made a charming little meal before going to bed. She often took him on her
      knees and covered him with kisses, murmuring in his ear with passionate
      tenderness. She called him: &ldquo;My little flower, my cherub, my adored angel,
      my divine jewel.&rdquo; He softly accepted her caresses, concealing his head on
      the old maid&rsquo;s shoulder. Although he was now nearly fifteen years old, he
      had remained small and weak, and had a rather sickly appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes Mademoiselle Source brought him to the city to see two married
      female relatives of hers, distant cousins, who were living in the suburbs,
      and who were the only members of her family in existence. The two women
      had always found fault with her for having adopted this boy, on account of
      the inheritance; but for all that they gave her a cordial welcome, having
      still hopes of getting a share for themselves, a third, no doubt, if what
      she possessed were only equally divided.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was happy, very happy, always taken up with her adopted child. She
      bought books for him to improve his mind, and he devoted himself ardently
      to reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      He no longer now climbed on her knees to fondle her as he had formerly
      done; but instead would go and sit down in his little chair in the
      chimney-corner and open a volume. The lamp placed at the edge of the
      little table, above his head, shone on his curly hair and on a portion of
      his forehead; he did not move, he did not raise his eyes, he did not make
      any gesture. He read on, interested, entirely absorbed in the adventures
      which formed the subject of the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, seated opposite to him, gazed at him with an eager, steady look,
      astonished at his studiousness, jealous, often on the point of bursting
      into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said to him now and then: &ldquo;You will fatigue yourself, my treasure!&rdquo; in
      the hope that he would raise his head and come across to embrace her; but
      he did not even answer her; he had not heard or understood what she was
      saying; he paid no attention to anything save what he read in these pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two years he devoured an incalculable number of volumes. His character
      changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, he asked Mademoiselle Source many times for money, which she
      gave him. As he always wanted more, she ended by refusing, for she was
      both regular and energetic and knew how to act rationally when it was
      necessary to do so. By dint of entreaties he obtained a large sum one
      night from her; but when he urged her to give him another sum a few days
      later, she showed herself inflexible, and did not give way to him further,
      in fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      He appeared to be satisfied with her decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      He again became quiet, as he had formerly been, loving to remain seated
      for entire hours, without moving, plunged in deep reverie. He now did not
      even talk to Madame Source, merely answering her remarks with short,
      formal words. Nevertheless, he was agreeable and attentive in his manner
      toward her; but he never embraced her now.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had by this time grown slightly afraid of him when they sat facing one
      another at night at opposite sides of the fireplace. She wanted to wake
      him up, to make him say something, no matter what, that would break this
      dreadful silence, which was like the darkness of a wood. But he did not
      appear to listen to her, and she shuddered with the terror of a poor
      feeble woman when she had spoken to him five or six times successively
      without being able to get a word out of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the matter with him? What was going on in that closed-up head?
      When she had been thus two or three hours sitting opposite him, she felt
      herself getting daft, and longed to rush away and to escape into the open
      country in order to avoid that mute, eternal companionship and also some
      vague danger, which she could not define, but of which she had a
      presentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She frequently shed tears when she was alone. What was the matter with
      him? When she gave expression to a desire, he unmurmuringly carried it
      into execution. When she wanted to have anything brought to her from the
      city, he immediately went there to procure it. She had no complaint to
      make of him; no, indeed! And yet&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Another year flitted by, and it seemed to her that a new modification had
      taken place in the mind of the young man. She perceived it; she felt it;
      she divined it. How? No matter! She was sure she was not mistaken; but she
      could not have explained in what the unknown thoughts of this strange
      youth had changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to her that till now he had been like a person in a hesitating
      frame of mind who had suddenly arrived at a determination. This idea came
      to her one evening as she met his glance, a fixed, singular glance which
      she had not seen in his face before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he commenced to watch her incessantly, and she wished she could hide
      herself in order to avoid that cold eye, riveted on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept staring at her, evening after evening for hours together, only
      averting his eyes when she said, utterly unnerved:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not look at me like that, my child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he bowed his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the moment her back was turned, she once more felt that his eye was
      upon her. Wherever she went he pursued her with his persistent gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, when she was walking in her little garden, she suddenly noticed
      him squatted on the stump of a tree as if he were lying in wait for her;
      and again when she sat in front of the house mending stockings while he
      was digging some cabbage-bed, he kept watching her, as he worked, in a
      sly, continuous fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in vain that she asked him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, my boy? For the last three years, you have
      become very different. I don&rsquo;t find you the same. Tell me what ails you,
      and what you are thinking of, I beg of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He invariably replied, in a quiet, weary tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, nothing ails me, Aunt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when she persisted, appealing to him thus: &ldquo;Ah! my child, answer me,
      answer me when I speak to you. If you knew what grief you caused me, you
      would always answer, and you would not look at me that way. Have you any
      trouble? Tell me, I&rsquo;ll console you!&rdquo; he would turn away with a tired air,
      murmuring:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is nothing the matter with me, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not grown much, having always a childish aspect, although the
      features of his face were those of a man. They were, however, hard and
      badly cut. He seemed incomplete, abortive, only half finished, and
      disquieting as a mystery. He was a close impenetrable being, in whom there
      seemed always to be some active, dangerous mental travail taking place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Source was quite conscious of all this, and she could not,
      from that time forth, sleep at night, so great was her anxiety. Frightful
      terrors, dreadful nightmares assailed her. She shut herself up in her own
      room and barricaded the door, tortured by fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was she afraid of? She could not tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fear of everything, of the night, of the walls, of the shadows thrown by
      the moon on the white curtains of the windows, and, above all, fear of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why? What had she to fear? Did she know what it was? She could live this
      way no longer! She felt certain that a misfortune threatened her, a
      frightful misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      She set forth secretly one morning and went into the city to see her
      relatives. She told them about the matter in a gasping voice. The two
      women thought she was going mad and tried to reassure her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you knew the way he looks at me from morning till night. He never
      takes his eyes off me! At times I feel a longing to cry for help, to call
      in the neighbors, so much am I afraid. But what could I say to them? He
      does nothing to me except to keep looking at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two female cousins asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he ever brutal to you? Does he give you sharp answers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, never; he does everything I wish; he works hard; he is steady; but I
      am so frightened I don&rsquo;t mind that much. He has something in his head, I
      am certain of that&mdash;quite certain. I don&rsquo;t care to remain all alone
      like that with him in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The relatives, scared by her words, declared to her that they were
      astonished and could not understand her; and they advised her to keep
      silent about her fears and her plans, without, however, dissuading her
      from coming to reside in the city, hoping in that way that the entire
      inheritance would eventually fall into their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      They even promised to assist her in selling her house and in finding
      another near them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Source returned home. But her mind was so much upset that she
      trembled at the slightest noise, and her hands shook whenever any trifling
      disturbance agitated her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice she went again to consult her relatives, quite determined now not to
      remain any longer in this way in her lonely dwelling. At last she found a
      little cottage in the suburbs, which suited her, and privately she bought
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The signature of the contract took place on a Tuesday morning, and
      Mademoiselle Source devoted the rest of the day to the preparations for
      her change of residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening she got into the diligence which passed
      within a few hundred yards of her house, and she told the conductor to let
      her down in the place where it was his custom to stop for her. The man
      called out to her as he whipped his horses:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, Mademoiselle Source&mdash;good night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She replied as she walked on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, Père Joseph.&rdquo; Next morning, at half past seven, the postman
      who conveyed letters to the village, noticed at the crossroad, not far
      from the highroad, a large splash of blood not yet dry. He said to
      himself: &ldquo;Hallo! some boozer must have been bleeding from the nose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he perceived ten paces farther on a pocket-handkerchief also stained
      with blood. He picked them up. The linen was fine, and the postman, in
      alarm, made his way over to the dike, where he fancied he saw a strange
      object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Source was lying at the foot on the grass, her throat cut
      open with a knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, the gendarmes, the examining magistrate, and other
      authorities made an inquiry as to the cause of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two female relatives, called as witnesses, told all about the old
      maid&rsquo;s fears and her last plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orphan was arrested. Since the death of the woman who had adopted him,
      he wept from morning till night, plunged, at least to all appearance, in
      the most violent grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      He proved that he had spent the evening up to eleven o&rsquo;clock in a cafe.
      Ten persons had seen him, having remained there till his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the driver of the diligence stated that he had set down the murdered
      woman on the road between half past nine and ten o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The accused was acquitted. A will, a long time made, which had been left
      in the hands of a notary in Rennes, made him universal legatee. So he
      inherited everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time the people of the country put him into quarantine, as they
      still suspected him. His house, which was that of the dead woman, was
      looked upon as accursed. People avoided him in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he showed himself so good-natured, so open, so familiar, that
      gradually these horrible doubts were forgotten. He was generous, obliging,
      ready to talk to the humblest about anything as long as they cared to talk
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notary, Maître Rameay, was one of the first to take his part,
      attracted by his smiling loquacity. He said one evening at a dinner at the
      tax-collector&rsquo;s house:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man who speaks with such facility and who is always in good-humor could
      not have such a crime on his conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Touched by this argument, the others who were present reflected, and they
      recalled to mind the long conversations with this man who made them stop
      almost by force at the road corners to communicate his ideas to them, who
      insisted on their going into his house when they were passing by his
      garden, who could crack a joke better than the lieutenant of the gendarmes
      himself, and who possessed such contagious gaiety that, in spite of the
      repugnance with which he inspired them, they could not keep from always
      laughing when in his company.
    </p>
    <p>
      All doors were opened to him after a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is, to-day, the mayor of his own community.

    <h2>
      A LIVELY FRIEND
    </h2>
    <p>
      They had beer, constantly in each other&rsquo;s society for a whole winter in
      Paris. After having lost sight of each other, as generally happens in such
      cases, after leaving college, the two friends met again one night, long
      years after, already old and white-haired, the one a bachelor, the other
      married.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Meroul lived six months in Paris and six months in his little
      château at Tourbeville. Having married the daughter of a gentleman in the
      district, he had lived a peaceful, happy life with the indolence of a man
      who has nothing to do. With a calm temperament and a sedate mind, without
      any intellectual audacity or tendency toward revolutionary independence of
      thought, he passed his time in mildly regretting the past, in deploring
      the morals and the institutions of to-day, and in repeating every moment
      to his wife, who raised her eyes to heaven, and sometimes her hands also,
      in token of energetic assent:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under what a government do we live, great God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Meroul mentally resembled her husband, just as if they had been
      brother and sister. She knew by tradition that one ought, first of all, to
      reverence the Pope and the King!
    </p>
    <p>
      And she loved them and respected them from the bottom of her heart,
      without knowing them, with a poetic exaltation, with a hereditary
      devotion, with all the sensibility of a well-born woman. She was kindly in
      every feeling of her soul. She had no child, and was incessantly
      regretting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When M. de Meroul came across his old schoolfellow Joseph Mouradour at a
      ball, he experienced from this meeting a profound and genuine delight, for
      they had been very fond of one another in their youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      After exclamations of astonishment over the changes caused by age in their
      bodies and their faces, they had asked one another a number of questions
      as to their respective careers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph Mouradour, a native of the south of France, had become a
      councillor-general in his own neighborhood. Frank in his manners, he spoke
      briskly and without any circumspection, telling all his thoughts with
      sheer indifference to prudential considerations. He was a Republican, of
      that race of good-natured Republicans who make their own ease the law of
      their existence, and who carry freedom of speech to the verge of
      brutality.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called at his friend&rsquo;s address in Paris, and was immediately a
      favorite, on account of his easy cordiality, in spite of his advanced
      opinions. Madame de Meroul exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity! such a charming man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. de Meroul said to his friend, in a sincere and confidential tone: &ldquo;You
      cannot imagine what a wrong you do to our country.&rdquo; He was attached to his
      friend nevertheless, for no bonds are more solid than those of childhood
      renewed in later life. Joseph Mouradour chaffed the husband and wife,
      called them &ldquo;my loving turtles,&rdquo; and occasionally gave vent to loud
      declarations against people who were behind the age, against all sorts of
      prejudices and traditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he thus directed the flood of his democratic eloquence, the married
      pair, feeling ill at ease, kept silent through a sense of propriety and
      good-breeding; then the husband tried to turn off the conversation in
      order to avoid any friction. Joseph Mouradour did not want to know anyone
      unless he was free to say what he liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summer came round. The Merouls knew no greater pleasure than to receive
      their old friends in their country house at Tourbeville. It was an
      intimate and healthy pleasure, the pleasure of homely gentlefolk who had
      spent most of their lives in the country. They used to go to the nearest
      railway station to meet some of their guests, and drove them to the house
      in their carriage, watching for compliments on their district, on the
      rapid vegetation, on the condition of the roads in the department, on the
      cleanliness of the peasants&rsquo; houses, on the bigness of the cattle they saw
      in the fields, on everything that met the eye as far as the edge of the
      horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      They liked to have it noticed that their horse trotted in a wonderful
      manner for an animal employed a part of the year in field-work; and they
      awaited with anxiety the newcomer&rsquo;s opinion on their family estate,
      sensitive to the slightest word, grateful for the slightest gracious
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph Mouradour was invited, and he announced his arrival. The wife and
      the husband came to meet the train, delighted to have the opportunity of
      doing the honors of their house.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he perceived them, Joseph Mouradour jumped out of his carriage
      with a vivacity which increased their satisfaction. He grasped their hands
      warmly, congratulated them, and intoxicated them with compliments.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quite charming in his manner as they drove along the road to the
      house; he expressed astonishment at the height of the trees, the
      excellence of the crops, and the quickness of the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he placed his foot on the steps in front of the chateau, M. de Meroul
      said to him with a certain friendly solemnity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you are at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joseph Mouradour answered: &ldquo;Thanks, old fellow; I counted on that. For my
      part, besides, I never put myself out with my friends. That&rsquo;s the only
      hospitality I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he went up to his own room, where he put on the costume of a peasant,
      as he was pleased to describe it, and he came down again not very long
      after, attired in blue linen, with yellow boots, in the careless rig-out
      of a Parisian out for a holiday. He seemed, too, to have become more
      common, more jolly, more familiar, having assumed along with his would-be
      rustic garb a free and easy swagger which he thought suited the style of
      dress. His new apparel somewhat shocked M. and Madame de Meroul, who even
      at home on their estate always remained serious and respectable, as the
      particle &ldquo;de&rdquo; before their name exacted a certain amount of ceremonial
      even with their intimate friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      After lunch they went to visit the farms; and the Parisian stupefied the
      respectable peasants by talking to them as if he were a comrade of theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, the curé dined at the house&mdash;a fat old priest,
      wearing his Sunday suit, who had been specially asked that day in order to
      meet the newcomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Joseph saw him he made a grimace, then he stared at the priest in
      astonishment as if he belonged to some peculiar race of beings, the like
      of which he had never seen before at such close quarters. He told a few
      stories allowable enough with a friend after dinner, but apparently
      somewhat out of place in the presence of an ecclesiastic. He did not say,
      &ldquo;Monsieur l&rsquo;Abbé,&rdquo; but merely &ldquo;Monsieur&rdquo;; and he embarrassed the priest
      with philosophical views as to the various superstitions that prevailed on
      the surface of the globe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your God, Monsieur, is one of those persons whom we must respect, but
      also one of those who must be discussed. Mine is called Reason; he has
      from time immemorial been the enemy of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Merouls, greatly put out, attempted to divert his thoughts. The curé
      left very early.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the husband gently remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went a little too far with that priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Joseph immediately replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very good joke, too! Am I to bother my brains about a
      devil-dodger? At any rate, do me the favor of not ever again having such
      an old fogy to dinner. Confound his impudence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my friend, remember his sacred character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joseph Mouradour interrupted him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. We must treat them like girls who get roses for being well
      behaved! That&rsquo;s all right, my boy! When these people respect my
      convictions, I will respect theirs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was all that happened that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Madame de Meroul, on entering her drawing-room, saw lying on
      the table three newspapers which made her draw back in horror, &ldquo;Le
      Voltaire,&rdquo; &ldquo;La République Française,&rdquo; and &ldquo;La Justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently Joseph Mouradour, still in his blue blouse, appeared on the
      threshold, reading &ldquo;L&rsquo;Intransigéant&rdquo; attentively. He exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a splendid article by Rochefort. That fellow is marvelous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He read the article in a loud voice, laying so much stress on its most
      striking passages that he did not notice the entrance of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Meroul had a paper in each hand: &ldquo;Le Gaulois&rdquo; for himself and &ldquo;Le
      Clarion&rdquo; for his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ardent prose of the master-writer who overthrew the empire, violently
      declaimed, recited in the accent of the south, rang through the peaceful
      drawing-room, shook the old curtains with their rigid folds, seemed to
      splash the walls, the large upholstered chairs, the solemn furniture fixed
      in the same position for the past century, with a hail of words,
      rebounding, impudent, ironical, and crushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband and the wife, the one standing, the other seated, listened in
      a state of stupor, so scandalized that they no longer even ventured to
      make a gesture. Mouradour flung out the concluding passage in the article
      as one sets off a stream of fireworks; then in an emphatic tone he
      remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a stinger, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly he perceived the two prints belonging to his friend, and he
      seemed himself for a moment overcome with astonishment. Then he came
      across to his host with great strides, demanding in an angry tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to do with these papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. de. Meroul replied in a hesitating voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, these&mdash;these are my&mdash;my newspapers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your newspapers! Look here, now, you are only laughing at me! You will do
      me the favor to read mine, to stir you up with a few new ideas, and, as
      for yours&mdash;this is what I do with them&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And before his host, filled with confusion, could prevent him, he seized
      the two newspapers and flung them out through the window. Then he gravely
      placed &ldquo;La Justice&rdquo; in the hands of Madame de Meroul and &ldquo;Le Voltaire&rdquo; in
      those of her husband, himself sinking into an armchair to finish
      &ldquo;L&rsquo;Intransigéant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The husband and the wife, through feelings of delicacy, made a show of
      reading a little, then they handed back the Republican newspapers which
      they touched with their finger-tips as if they had been poisoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mouradour burst out laughing, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A week of this sort of nourishment, and I&rsquo;ll have you converted to my
      ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a week, in fact, he ruled the house. He had shut the door on
      the curé, whom Madame de Meroul went to see in secret. He gave orders that
      neither the &ldquo;Gaulois&rdquo; nor the &ldquo;Clarion&rdquo; were to be admitted into the
      house, which a manservant went to get in a mysterious fashion at the
      post-office, and which, on his entrance, were hidden away under the sofa
      cushions. He regulated everything just as he liked, always charming,
      always good-natured, a jovial and all-powerful tyrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other friends were about to come on a visit, religious people with
      Legitimist opinions. The master and mistress of the chateau considered it
      would be impossible to let them meet their lively guest, and not knowing
      what to do, announced to Joseph Mouradour one evening that they were
      obliged to go away from home for a few days about a little matter of
      business, and they begged of him to remain in the house alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He showed no trace of emotion, and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; &lsquo;tis all the same to me; I&rsquo;ll wait here for you as long as you
      like. What I say is this&mdash;there need be no ceremony between friends.
      You&rsquo;re quite right to look after your own affairs&mdash;why the devil
      shouldn&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;ll not take offense at your doing that, quite the
      contrary. It only makes me feel quite at my ease with you. Go, my friends&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      wait for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. and Madame de Meroul started next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is waiting for them.

    <h2>
      THE BLIND MAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      How is it that the sunlight gives us such joy? Why does this radiance when
      it falls on the earth fill us so much with the delight of living? The sky
      is all blue, the fields are all green, the houses all white; and our
      ravished eyes drink in those bright colors which bring mirthfulness to our
      souls. And then there springs up in our hearts a desire to dance, a desire
      to run, a desire to sing, a happy lightness of thought, a sort of enlarged
      tenderness; we feel a longing to embrace the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blind, as they sit in the doorways, impassive in their eternal
      darkness, remain as calm as ever in the midst of this fresh gaiety, and,
      not comprehending what is taking place around them, they continue every
      moment to stop their dogs from gamboling.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, at the close of the day, they are returning home on the arm of a
      young brother or a little sister, if the child says: &ldquo;It was a very fine
      day!&rdquo; the other answers: &ldquo;I could notice that &lsquo;twas fine. Lulu wouldn&rsquo;t
      keep quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have known one of these men whose life was one of the most cruel
      martyrdoms that could possibly be conceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a peasant, the son of a Norman farmer. As long as his father and
      mother lived, he was more or less taken care of; he suffered little save
      from his horrible infirmity; but as soon as the old people were gone, a
      life of atrocious misery commenced for him. A dependent on a sister of
      his, everybody in the farmhouse treated him as a beggar who is eating the
      bread of others. At every meal the very food he swallowed was made a
      subject of reproach against him; he was called a drone, a clown; and
      although his brother-in-law had taken possession of his portion of the
      inheritance, the soup was given to him grudgingly&mdash;just enough to
      save him from dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face was very pale and his two big white eyes were like wafers. He
      remained unmoved in spite of the insults inflicted upon him, so shut up in
      himself that one could not tell whether he felt them at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, he had never known any tenderness; his mother had always treated
      him very unkindly, caring scarcely at all for him; for in country places
      the useless are obnoxious, and the peasants would be glad, like hens, to
      kill the infirm of their species.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the soup had been gulped down, he went to the door in summer
      time and sat down, to the chimney-corner in winter time, and, after that,
      never stirred till night. He made no gesture, no movement; only his
      eyelids, quivering from some nervous affection, fell down sometimes over
      his white sightless orbs. Had he any intellect, any thinking faculty, any
      consciousness of his own existence? Nobody cared to inquire as to whether
      he had or no.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some years things went on in this fashion But his incapacity for doing
      anything as well as his impassiveness eventually exasperated his
      relatives, and he became a laughing-stock, a sort of martyred buffoon, a
      prey given over to native ferocity, to the savage gaiety of the brutes who
      surrounded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to imagine all the cruel practical jokes inspired by his
      blindness. And, in order to have some fun in return for feeding him, they
      now converted his meals into hours of pleasure for the neighbors and of
      punishment for the helpless creature himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peasants from the nearest houses came to this entertainment; it was
      talked about from door to door, and every day the kitchen of the farmhouse
      was full of people. For instance, they put on the table in front of his
      plate, when he was beginning to take the soup, a cat or a dog. The animal
      instinctively scented out the man&rsquo;s infirmity, and, softly approaching,
      commenced eating noiselessly, lapping up the soup daintily; and, when a
      rather loud licking of the tongue awakened the poor fellow&rsquo;s attention, it
      would prudently scamper away to avoid the blow of the spoon directed at it
      by the blind man at random!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the spectators, huddled against the walls, burst out laughing, nudged
      each other, and stamped their feet on the floor. And he, without ever
      uttering a word, would continue eating with the aid of his right hand,
      while stretching out his left to protect and defend his plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      At another time they made him chew corks, bits of wood, leaves, or even
      filth, which he was unable to distinguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, they got tired even of these practical jokes; and the
      brother-in-law, mad at having to support him always, struck him, cuffed
      him incessantly, laughing at the useless efforts of the other to ward off
      or return the blows. Then came a new pleasure&mdash;the pleasure of
      smacking his face. And the plowmen, the servant-girls, and even every
      passing vagabond were every moment giving him cuffs, which caused his
      eyelashes to twitch spasmodically. He did not know where to hide himself
      and remained with his arms always held out to guard against people coming
      too close to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he was forced to beg.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was placed somewhere on the highroad on market-days, and, as soon as he
      heard the sound of footsteps or the rolling of a vehicle, he reached out
      his hat, stammering:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charity, if you please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the peasant is not lavish, and, for whole weeks, he did not bring back
      a sou.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he became the victim of furious, pitiless hatred. And this is how he
      died.
    </p>
    <p>
      One winter, the ground was covered with snow, and it froze horribly. Now
      his brother-in-law led him one morning at this season a great distance
      along the highroad in order that he might solicit alms. The blind man was
      left there all day, and, when night came on, the brother-in-law told the
      people of his house that he could find no trace of the mendicant. Then he
      added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! best not bother about him! He was cold, and got some one to take
      him away. Never fear! he&rsquo;s not lost. He&rsquo;ll turn up soon enough to-morrow
      to eat the soup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day he did not come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      After long hours of waiting, stiffened with the cold, feeling that he was
      dying, the blind man began to walk. Being unable to find his way along the
      road, owing to its thick coating of ice, he went on at random, falling
      into dikes, getting up again, without uttering a sound, his sole object
      being to find some house where he could take shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But by degrees the descending snow made a numbness steal over him, and his
      feeble limbs being incapable of carrying him farther, he had to sit down
      in the middle of an open field. He did not get up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The white flakes which kept continually falling buried him, so that his
      body, quite stiff and stark, disappeared under the incessant accumulation
      of their rapidly thickening mass; and nothing any longer indicated the
      place where the corpse was lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      His relatives made pretense of inquiring about him and searching for him
      for about a week. They even made a show of weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winter was severe, and the thaw did not set in quickly. Now, one
      Sunday, on their way to mass, the farmers noticed a great flight of crows,
      who were whirling endlessly above the open field, and then, like a shower
      of black rain, descended in a heap at the same spot, ever going and
      coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following week these gloomy birds were still there. There was a crowd
      of them up in the air, as if they had gathered from all corners of the
      horizon; and they swooped down with a great cawing into the shining snow,
      which they filled curiously with patches of black, and in which they kept
      rummaging obstinately. A young fellow went to see what they were doing,
      and discovered the body of the blind man, already half devoured, mangled.
      His wan eyes had disappeared, pecked out by the long voracious beaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I can never feel the glad radiance of sunlit days without sadly
      remembering and gloomily pondering over the fate of the beggar so deprived
      of joy in life that his horrible death was a relief for all those who had
      known him.

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR AUNT,&mdash;I am going to pay you a visit without making much fuss
      about it. I shall be at Les Fresnes on the second of September, the day
      before the hunting season opens; I do not want to miss it, so that I may
      tease these gentlemen. You are very obliging, Aunt, and I would like you
      to allow them to dine with you, as you usually do when there are no
      strange guests, without dressing or shaving for the occasion, on the
      ground that they are fatigued.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are delighted, of course, when I am not present. But I shall be
      there, and I shall hold a review, like a general, at the dinner-hour; and,
      if I find a single one of them at all careless in dress, no matter how
      little, I mean to send him down to the kitchen to the servant-maids.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men of to-day have so little consideration for others and so little
      good manners that one must be always severe with them. We live indeed in
      an age of vulgarity. When they quarrel with one another, they attack one
      another with insults worthy of street porters, and, in our presence, they
      do not conduct themselves even as well as our servants. It is at the
      seaside that you see this most clearly. They are to be found there in
      battalions, and you can judge them in the lump. Oh, what coarse beings
      they are!
    </p>
    <p>
      Just imagine, in a train, one of them, a gentleman who looked well as I
      thought, at first sight, thanks to his tailor, was dainty enough to take
      off his boots in order to put on a pair of old shoes! Another, an old man,
      who was probably some wealthy upstart (these are the most ill-bred), while
      sitting opposite to me, had the delicacy to place his two feet on the seat
      quite close to me. This is a positive fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the watering-places, there is an unrestrained outpouring of
      unmannerliness. I must here make one admission&mdash;that my indignation
      is perhaps due to the fact that I am not accustomed to associate as a rule
      with the sort of people one comes across here, for I should be less
      shocked by their manners if I had the opportunity of observing them
      oftener. In the inquiry-office of the hotel I was nearly thrown down by a
      young man, who snatched the key over my head. Another knocked against me
      so violently without begging my pardon or lifting his hat, coming away
      from a ball at the Casino, that he gave me a pain in the chest. It is the
      same way with all of them. Watch them addressing ladies on the terrace:
      they scarcely ever bow. They merely raise their hands to their headgear.
      But indeed, as they are all more or less bald, it is the best plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what exasperates and disgusts me especially is the liberty they take
      of talking publicly, without any precaution whatsoever, about the most
      revolting adventures. When two men are together, they relate to each
      other, in the broadest language and with the most abominable comments,
      really horrible stories, without caring in the slightest degree whether a
      woman&rsquo;s ear is within reach of their voices. Yesterday, on the beach, I
      was forced to go away from the place where I sat in order not to be any
      longer the involuntary confidant of an obscene anecdote, told in such
      immodest language that I felt as much humiliated as I was indignant at
      having heard it. Would not the most elementary good-breeding have taught
      them to speak in a lower tone about such matters when we are near at hand?
      Etretat is, moreover, the country of gossip and scandal. From five to
      seven o&rsquo;clock you can see people wandering about in quest of nasty stories
      about others, which they retail from group to group. As you remarked to
      me, my dear Aunt, tittle-tattle is the mark of petty individuals and petty
      minds. It is also the consolation of women who are no longer loved or
      sought after. It is enough for me to observe the women who are fondest of
      gossiping to be persuaded that you are quite right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other day I was present at a musical evening at the Casino, given by a
      remarkable artist, Madame Masson, who sings in a truly delightful manner.
      I took the opportunity of applauding the admirable Coquelin, as well as
      two charming boarders of the Vaudeville, M&mdash;&mdash; and Meillet. I
      was able, on the occasion, to see all the bathers collected together this
      year on the beach. There were not many persons of distinction among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day I went to lunch at Yport. I noticed a tall man with a beard who
      was coming out of a large house like a castle. It was the painter, Jean
      Paul Laurens. He is not satisfied apparently with imprisoning the subjects
      of his pictures; he insists on imprisoning himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I found myself seated on the shingle close to a man still young, of
      gentle and refined appearance, who was reading some verses. But he read
      them with such concentration, with such passion, I may say, that he did
      not even raise his eyes toward me. I was somewhat astonished, and I asked
      the conductor of the baths, without appearing to be much concerned, the
      name of this gentleman. I laughed inwardly a little at this reader of
      rhymes: he seemed behind the age, for a man. This person, I thought, must
      be a simpleton. Well, Aunt, I am now infatuated about this stranger. Just
      fancy, his name is Sully Prudhomme! I turned round to look at him at my
      ease, just where I sat. His face possesses the two qualities of calmness
      and elegance. As somebody came to look for him, I was able to hear his
      voice, which is sweet and almost timid. He would certainly not tell
      obscene stories aloud in public, or knock against ladies without
      apologizing. He is sure to be a man of refinement, but his refinement is
      of an almost morbid, vibrating character. I will try this winter to get an
      introduction to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no more news to tell you, my dear Aunt, and I must interrupt this
      letter in haste, as the post-hour is near. I kiss your hands and your
      cheeks.

    <p>
      P.S.&mdash;I should add, however, by way of justification of French
      politeness, that our fellow-countrymen are, when traveling, models of good
      manners in comparison with the abominable English, who seem to have been
      brought up by stable-boys, so much do they take care not to incommode
      themselves in any way, while they always incommode their neighbors.

      LES FRESNES, Saturday.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear child,&mdash;Many of the things you have said to me are very
      reasonable, but that does not prevent you from being wrong. Like you, I
      used formerly to feel very indignant at the impoliteness of men, who, as I
      supposed, constantly treated me with neglect; but, as I grew older and
      reflected on everything, putting aside coquetry and observing things
      without taking any part in them myself, I perceived this much&mdash;that
      if men are not always polite, women are always indescribably rude.
    </p>
    <p>
      We imagine that we should be permitted to do anything, my darling, and at
      the same time we consider that we have a right to the utmost respect, and
      in the most flagrant manner we commit actions devoid of that elementary
      good-breeding of which you speak with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I find, on the contrary, that men have, for us, much consideration, as
      compared with our bearing toward them. Besides, darling, men must needs
      be, and are, what we make them. In a state of society where women are all
      true gentlewomen all men would become gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark my words; just observe and reflect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look at two women meeting in the street. What an attitude each assumes
      toward the other! What disparaging looks! What contempt they throw into
      each glance! How they toss their heads while they inspect each other to
      find something to condemn! And, if the footpath is narrow, do you think
      one woman will make room for another, or will beg pardon as she sweeps by?
      Never! When two men jostle each other by accident in some narrow lane,
      each of them bows and at the same time gets out of the other&rsquo;s way, while
      we women press against each other, stomach to stomach, face to face,
      insolently staring each other out of countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look at two women who are acquaintances meeting on a staircase before the
      drawing-room door of a friend of theirs to whom one has just paid a visit,
      and to whom the other is about to pay a visit. They begin to talk to each
      other, and block up the passage. If anyone happens to be coming up behind
      them, man or woman, do you imagine that they will put themselves half an
      inch out of their way? Never! never!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was waiting myself, with my watch in my hands, one day last winter, at a
      certain drawing-room door. Behind me two gentlemen were also waiting
      without showing any readiness to lose their temper, like me. The reason
      was that they had long grown accustomed to our unconscionable insolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other day, before leaving Paris, I went to dine with no less a person
      than your husband in the Champs-Elysees, in order to enjoy the open air.
      Every table was occupied. The waiter asked us not to go, and there would
      soon be a vacant table.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, I noticed an elderly lady of noble figure, who, having
      paid the amount of her check, seemed on the point of going away. She saw
      me, scanned me from head to foot, and did not budge. For more than a full
      quarter of an hour she sat there, immovable, putting on her gloves, and
      calmly staring at those who were waiting like myself. Now, two young men
      who were just finishing their dinner, having seen me in their turn,
      quickly summoned the waiter in order to pay whatever they owed, and at
      once offered me their seats, even insisting on standing while waiting for
      their change. And, bear in mind, my fair niece, that I am no longer
      pretty, like you, but old and white-haired.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is we (do you see?) who should be taught politeness; and the task would
      be such a difficult one that Hercules himself would not be equal to it.
      You speak to me about Etretat, and about the people who indulge in
      &ldquo;tittle-tattle&rdquo; along the beach of that delightful watering-place. It is a
      spot now lost to me, a thing of the past, but I found much amusement there
      in days gone by.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were only a few of us, people in good society, really good society,
      and a few artists, and we all fraternized. We paid little attention to
      gossip in those days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, as we had no insipid Casino, where people only gather for show,
      where they talk in whispers, where they dance stupidly, where they succeed
      in thoroughly boring one another, we sought some other way of passing our
      evenings pleasantly. Now, just guess what came into the head of one of our
      husbandry? Nothing less than to go and dance each night in one of the
      farmhouses in the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      We started out in a group with a street-organ, generally played by Le
      Poittevin, the painter, with a cotton nightcap on his head. Two men
      carried lanterns. We followed in procession, laughing and chattering like
      a pack of fools.
    </p>
    <p>
      We woke up the farmer and his servant-maids and laboring men. We got them
      to make onion-soup (horror!), and we danced under the apple-trees, to the
      sound of the barrel-organ. The cocks waking up began to crow in the
      darkness of the outhouses; the horses began prancing on the straw of their
      stables. The cool air of the country caressed our cheeks with the smell of
      grass and of new-mown hay.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long ago it is! How long ago it is. It is thirty years since then!
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not want you, my darling, to come for the opening of the hunting
      season. Why spoil the pleasure of our friends by inflicting on them
      fashionable toilettes after a day of vigorous exercise in the country?
      This is the way, child, that men are spoiled. I embrace you.

    <h2>
      THE CAKE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Let us say that her name was Madame Anserre so as not to reveal her real
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was one of those Parisian comets which leave, as it were, a trail of
      fire behind them. She wrote verses and novels; she had a poetic heart, and
      was rarely beautiful. She opened her doors to very few&mdash;only to
      exceptional people, those who are commonly described as princes of
      something or other. To be a visitor at her house constituted a claim, a
      genuine claim to intellect: at least this was the estimate set on her
      invitations. Her husband played the part of an obscure satellite. To be
      the husband of a comet is not an easy thing. This husband had, however, an
      original idea, that of creating a State within a State, of possessing a
      merit of his own, a merit of the second order, it is true; but he did, in
      fact, in this fashion, on the days when his wife held receptions, hold
      receptions also on his own account. He had his special set who appreciated
      him, listened to him, and bestowed on him more attention than they did on
      his brilliant partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had devoted himself to agriculture&mdash;to agriculture in the Chamber.
      There are in the same way generals in the Chamber&mdash;those who are
      born, who live, and who die, on the round leather chairs of the War
      Office, are all of this sort, are they not? Sailors in the Chamber,&mdash;viz.,
      in the Admiralty,&mdash;colonizers in the Chamber, etc., etc. So he had
      studied agriculture, had studied it deeply, indeed, in its relations to
      the other sciences, to political economy, to the Fine Arts&mdash;we dress
      up the Fine Arts with every kind of science, and we even call the horrible
      railway bridges &ldquo;works of art.&rdquo; At length he reached the point when it was
      said of him: &ldquo;He is a man of ability.&rdquo; He was quoted in the technical
      reviews; his wife had succeeded in getting him appointed a member of a
      committee at the Ministry of Agriculture.
    </p>
    <p>
      This latest glory was quite sufficient for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the pretext of diminishing the expenses, he sent out invitations to
      his friends for the day when his wife received hers, so that they
      associated together, or rather did not&mdash;they formed two distinct
      groups. Madame, with her escort of artists, academicians, and ministers,
      occupied a kind of gallery, furnished and decorated in the style of the
      Empire. Monsieur generally withdrew with his agriculturists into a smaller
      portion of the house used as a smoking-room and ironically described by
      Madame Anserre as the Salon of Agriculture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two camps were clearly separate. Monsieur, without jealousy, moreover,
      sometimes penetrated into the Academy, and cordial hand-shakings were
      exchanged; but the Academy entertained infinite contempt for the Salon of
      Agriculture, and it was rarely that one of the princes of science, of
      thought, or of anything else, mingled with the agriculturists.
    </p>
    <p>
      These receptions occasioned little expense&mdash;a cup of tea, a cake,
      that was all. Monsieur, at an earlier period, had claimed two cakes, one
      for the Academy, and one for the agriculturists, but Madame having rightly
      suggested that this way of acting seemed to indicate two camps, two
      receptions, two parties, Monsieur did not press the matter, so that they
      used only one cake, of which Madame Anserre did the honors at the Academy,
      and which then passed into the Salon de Agriculture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, this cake was soon, for the Academy, a subject of observation well
      calculated to arouse curiosity. Madame Anserre never cut it herself. That
      function always fell to the lot of one or other of the illustrious guests.
      The particular duty, which was supposed to carry with it honorable
      distinction, was performed by each person for a pretty long period, in one
      case for three months, scarcely ever for more; and it was noticed that the
      privilege of &ldquo;cutting the cake&rdquo; carried with it a heap of other marks of
      superiority&mdash;a sort of royalty, or rather very accentuated
      viceroyalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reigning cutter spoke in a haughty tone, with an air of marked
      command; and all the favors of the mistress of the house were for him
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      These happy individuals were in moments of intimacy described in hushed
      tones behind doors as the &ldquo;favorites of the cake,&rdquo; and every change of
      favorite introduced into the Academy a sort of revolution. The knife was a
      scepter, the pastry an emblem; the chosen ones were congratulated. The
      agriculturists never cut the cake. Monsieur himself was always excluded,
      although he ate his share.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cake was cut in succession by poets, by painters, and by novelists. A
      great musician had the privilege of measuring the portions of the cake for
      some time; an ambassador succeeded him. Sometimes a man less well known,
      but elegant and sought after, one of those who are called according to the
      different epochs, &ldquo;true gentleman,&rdquo; or &ldquo;perfect knight,&rdquo; or &ldquo;dandy,&rdquo; or
      something else, seated himself, in his turn, before the symbolic cake.
      Each of them, during this ephemeral reign, exhibited greater consideration
      toward the husband; then, when the hour of his fall had arrived, he passed
      on the knife toward the other, and mingled once more with the crowd of
      followers and admirers of the &ldquo;beautiful Madame Anserre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This state of things lasted a long time; but comets do not always shine
      with the same brilliance. Everything gets worn out in society. One would
      have said that gradually the eagerness of the cutters grew feebler; they
      seemed to hesitate at times when the tray was held out to them; this
      office, once so much coveted, became less and less desired. It was
      retained for a shorter time; they appeared to be less proud of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Anserre was prodigal of smiles and civilities. Alas! no one was
      found any longer to cut it voluntarily. The newcomers seemed to decline
      the honor. The &ldquo;old favorites&rdquo; reappeared one by one like dethroned
      princes who have been replaced for a brief spell in power. Then, the
      chosen ones became few, very few. For a month (oh, prodigy!) M, Anserre
      cut open the cake; then he looked as if he were getting tired of it; and
      one evening Madame Anserre, the beautiful Madame Anserre, was seen cutting
      it herself. But this appeared to be very wearisome to her, and, next day,
      she urged one of her guests so strongly to do it that he did not dare to
      refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The symbol was too well known, however; the guests stared at one another
      with scared, anxious faces. To cut the cake was nothing, but the
      privileges to which this favor had always given a claim now frightened
      people; therefore, the moment the dish made its appearance the
      academicians rushed pellmell into the Salon of Agriculture, as if to
      shelter themselves behind the husband, who was perpetually smiling. And
      when Madame Anserre, in a state of anxiety, presented herself at the door
      with a cake in one hand and the knife in the other, they all seemed to
      form a circle around her husband as if to appeal to him for protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some years more passed. Nobody cut the cake now; but yielding to an old
      inveterate habit, the lady who had always been gallantly called &ldquo;the
      beautiful Madame Anserre&rdquo; looked out each evening for some devotee to take
      the knife, and each time the same movement took place around her, a
      general flight, skillfully arranged and full of combined maneuvers that
      showed great cleverness, in order to avoid the offer that was rising to
      her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, one evening, a young man presented himself at her reception&mdash;an
      innocent, unsophisticated youth. He knew nothing about the mystery of the
      cake; accordingly, when it appeared, and when all the rest ran away, when
      Madame Anserre took from the manservant&rsquo;s hands the dish and the pastry,
      he remained quietly by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought that perhaps he knew about the matter; she smiled, and in a
      tone which showed some emotion, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be kind enough, dear Monsieur, to cut this cake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He displayed the utmost readiness, and took off his gloves, flattered at
      such an honor being conferred on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to be sure, Madame, with the greatest pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some distance away in the corner of the gallery, in the frame of the door
      which led into the Salon of the Agriculturists, faces which expressed
      utter amazement were staring at him. Then, when the spectators saw the
      newcomer cutting without any hesitation, they quickly came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old poet jocosely slapped the neophyte on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, young man!&rdquo; he whispered in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others gazed at him with curiosity. Even the husband appeared to be
      surprised. As for the young man, he was astonished at the consideration
      which they suddenly seemed to show toward him; above all, he failed to
      comprehend the marked attentions, the manifest favor, and the species of
      mute gratitude which the mistress of the house bestowed on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears, however, that he eventually found out.
    </p>
    <p>
      At what moment, in what place, was the revelation made to him? Nobody
      could tell; but, when he again presented himself at the reception, he had
      a preoccupied air, almost a shamefaced look, and he cast around him a
      glance of uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell rang for tea. The manservant appeared. Madame Anserre, with a
      smile, seized the dish, casting a look about her for her young friend; but
      he had fled so precipitately that no trace of him could be seen any
      longer. Then, she went looking everywhere for him, and ere long she
      discovered him in the Salon of the Agriculturists. With his arm locked in
      that of the husband, he was consulting that gentleman as to the means
      employed for destroying phylloxera.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Monsieur,&rdquo; she said to him, &ldquo;will you be so kind as to cut this
      cake for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reddened to the roots of his hair, and hanging down his head, stammered
      out some excuses. Thereupon M. Anserre took pity on him, and turning
      toward his wife, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you might have the goodness not to disturb us. We are talking
      about agriculture. So get your cake cut by Baptiste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And since that day nobody has ever cut Madame Anserre&rsquo;s cake.

    <h2>
      THE CORSICAN BANDIT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The road, with a gentle winding, reached the middle of the forest. The
      huge pine-trees spread above our heads a mournful-looking vault, and gave
      forth a kind of long, sad wail, while at either side their straight,
      slender trunks formed, as it were, an army of organ-pipes, from which
      seemed to issue the low, monotonous music of the wind through the
      tree-tops.
    </p>
    <p>
      After three hours&rsquo; walking there was an opening in this row of tangled
      branches. Here and there an enormous pine-parasol, separated from the
      others, opening like an immense umbrella, displayed its dome of dark
      green; then, all of a sudden, we gained the boundary of the forest, some
      hundreds of meters below the defile which leads into the wild valley of
      Niolo.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the two projecting heights which commanded a view of this pass, some
      old trees, grotesquely twisted, seemed to have mounted with painful
      efforts, like scouts who had started in advance of the multitude heaped
      together in the rear. When we turned round we saw the entire forest
      stretched beneath our feet, like a gigantic basin of verdure, whose edges,
      which seemed to reach the sky, were composed of bare racks shutting in on
      every side.
    </p>
    <p>
      We resumed our walk, and, ten minutes later, we found ourselves in the
      defile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I beheld an astonishing landscape. Beyond another forest, a valley,
      but a valley such as I had never seen before, a solitude of stone ten
      leagues long, hollowed out between two high mountains, without a field or
      a tree to be seen. This was the Niolo valley, the fatherland of Corsican
      liberty, the inaccessible citadel, from which the invaders had never been
      able to drive out the mountaineers.
    </p>
    <p>
      My companion said to me: &ldquo;It is here, that all our bandits have taken
      refuge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ere long we were at the further end of this chasm, so wild, so
      inconceivably beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a blade of grass, not a plant&mdash;nothing but granite. As far as our
      eyes could reach we saw in front of us a desert of glittering stone,
      heated like an oven by a burning sun which seemed to hang for that very
      purpose right above the gorge. When we raised our eyes toward the crests
      we stood dazzled and stupefied by what we saw. They looked red and notched
      like festoons of coral, for all the summits are made of porphyry; and the
      sky overhead seemed violet, lilac, discolored by the vicinity of these
      strange mountains. Lower down the granite was of scintillating gray, and
      under our feet it seemed rasped, pounded; we were walking over shining
      powder. At our right, along a long and irregular course, a tumultuous
      torrent ran with a continuous roar. And we staggered along under this
      heat, in this light, in this burning, arid, desolate valley cut by this
      ravine of turbulent water which seemed to be ever hurrying onward, without
      being able to fertilize these rocks, lost in this furnace which greedily
      drank it up without being penetrated or refreshed by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly there was visible at our right a little wooden cross sunk in
      a little heap of stones. A man had been killed there; and I said to my
      companion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about your bandits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew the most celebrated of them, the terrible St. Lucia. I will tell
      you his history.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father was killed in a quarrel by a young man of the same district,
      it is said; and St. Lucia was left alone with his sister. He was a weak
      and timid youth, small, often ill, without any energy. He did not proclaim
      the <i>vendetta</i> against the assassin of his father. All his relatives
      came to see him, and implored of him to take vengeance; he remained deaf
      to their menaces and their supplications.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, following the old Corsican custom, his sister, in her indignation,
      carried away his black clothes, in order that he might not wear mourning
      for a dead man who had not been avenged. He was insensible to even this
      outrage, and rather than take down from the rack his father&rsquo;s gun, which
      was still loaded, he shut himself up, not daring to brave the looks of the
      young men of the district.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seemed to have even forgotten the crime, and he lived with his sister
      in the obscurity of their dwelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, one day, the man who was suspected of having committed the murder
      was about to get married. St. Lucia did not appear to be moved by this
      news; but, no doubt out of sheer bravado, the bridegroom, on his way to
      the church, passed before the two orphans&rsquo; house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The brother and the sister, at their window, were eating little fried
      cakes when the young man saw the bridal procession moving past the house.
      Suddenly he began to tremble, rose up without uttering a word, made the
      sign of the cross, took the gun which was hanging over the fireplace, and
      went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he spoke of this later on, he said: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what was the
      matter with me; it was like fire in my blood; I felt that I should do it,
      that in spite of everything, I could not resist, and I concealed the gun
      in a cave on the road to Corte.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An hour later, he came back, with nothing in his hand, and with his
      habitual sad air of weariness. His sister believed that there was nothing
      further in his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when night fell he disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His enemy had, the same evening, to repair to Corte on foot, accompanied
      by his two bridesmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was pursuing his way, singing as he went, when St. Lucia stood before
      him, and looking straight in the murderer&rsquo;s face, exclaimed: &lsquo;Now is the
      time!&rsquo; and shot him point-blank in the chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the bridesmen fled; the other stared at the young man, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What have you done, St. Lucia?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he was going to hasten to Corte for help, but St. Lucia said in a
      stern tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If you move another step, I&rsquo;ll shoot you through the legs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other, aware that till now he had always appeared timid, said to him:
      &lsquo;You would not dare to do it!&rsquo; and he was hurrying off when he fell,
      instantaneously, his thigh shattered by a bullet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And St. Lucia, coming over to where he lay, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am going to look at your wound; if it is not serious, I&rsquo;ll leave you
      there; if it is mortal, I&rsquo;ll finish you off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He inspected the wound, considered it mortal, and slowly re-loading his
      gun, told the wounded man to say a prayer, and shot him through the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next day he was in the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you know what this St. Lucia did after this?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All his family were arrested by the gendarmes. His uncle, the curé, who
      was suspected of having incited him to this deed of vengeance, was himself
      put into prison, and accused by the dead man&rsquo;s relatives. But he escaped,
      took a gun in his turn, and went to join his nephew in the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next, St. Lucia killed, one after the other, his uncle&rsquo;s accusers, and
      tore out their eyes to teach the others never to state what they had seen
      with their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He killed all the relatives, all the connections of his enemy&rsquo;s family.
      He massacred during his life fourteen gendarmes, burned down the houses of
      his adversaries, and was up to the day of his death the most terrible of
      the bandits, whose memory we have preserved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun disappeared behind Monte Cinto and the tall shadow of the granite
      mountain went to sleep on the granite of the valley. We quickened our pace
      in order to reach before night the little village of Albertaccio, nothing
      better than a heap of stones welded beside the stone flanks of a wild
      gorge. And I said as I thought of the bandit:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a terrible custom your <i>vendetta</i> is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My companion answered with an air of resignation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you have? A man must do his duty!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      THE DUEL
    </h2>
    <p>
      In society, they called him &ldquo;The handsome Signoles.&rdquo; He called himself
      Viscount Gontran Joseph de Signoles.
    </p>
    <p>
      An orphan and master of a sufficient fortune, he cut something of a
      figure, as the saying is. He had an attractive form, enough readiness of
      speech to make some attempt at wit, a certain natural grace of manner, an
      air of nobility and pride, and a mustache which was both formidable and
      pleasant to the eye&mdash;a thing that pleases the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in demand in drawing-rooms, sought for by waltzers, and he inspired
      in men that smiling enmity which one has for people of energetic physique.
      He was suspected of some love affairs which showed him capable of much
      discretion, for a young man. He lived happy, tranquil, in a state of moral
      well-being most complete. It was well known that he was good at handling a
      sword, and still better with a pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were to fight,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I should choose a pistol. With that
      weapon, I am sure of killing my man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, one evening, having escorted two young women, friends of his, to the
      theater, being also accompanied by their husbands, he offered them, after
      the play, an ice at Tortoni&rsquo;s. They had been there about ten minutes, when
      he perceived that a gentleman, seated at a neighboring table, gazed
      persistently at one of the ladies of his party. She seemed troubled and
      disturbed, lowering her eyes. Finally, she said to her husband:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man is staring me out of countenance. I do not know him; do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The husband, who had seen nothing, raised his eyes but declared:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young woman replied, half laughing, half angry: &ldquo;It is very annoying;
      that individual is spoiling my ice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The husband shrugged his shoulders, replying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! Pay no attention to him. If we were to notice all the insolent
      people we meet, there would be no end to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Viscount arose brusquely. He could not allow this unknown man to
      spoil an ice he had offered. It was to him that the injury was addressed,
      as it was through him and for him that his friends had entered this <i>café</i>.
      The affair, then, concerned him only. He advanced toward the man and said
      to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have, sir, a manner of looking at these ladies that is not to be
      tolerated. I beg to ask you to cease this attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other replied: &ldquo;So you command me to keep the peace, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With set teeth, the Viscount answered: &ldquo;Take care, sir, or you will force
      me to forget myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman replied with a single word, an obscene word which resounded
      from one end of the <i>café</i> to the other, and made each guest start
      with a sudden movement as if they were all on springs. Those that were in
      front turned around; all the others raised their heads; three waiters
      turned about on their heels as if on pivots; the two ladies at the counter
      bounded forward, then entirely turned their backs upon the scene, as if
      they had been two automatons obeying the same manipulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great silence. Then, suddenly, a sharp noise rent the air. The
      Viscount had struck his adversary. Everybody got up to interpose. Cards
      were exchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Viscount had returned home, he walked up and down his room at a
      lively pace for some minutes. He was too much agitated to reflect upon
      anything. One idea only hovered over his mind: &ldquo;a duel&rdquo;; and yet this idea
      awoke in him as yet, no emotion whatever. He had done what he ought to do;
      he had shown himself what he ought to be. People would talk of it, approve
      of it, and congratulate him. He said aloud, in a high voice, as one speaks
      when he is much troubled in thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a beast that man is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he sat down and began to reflect. He would have to find some seconds
      in the morning. Whom should he choose? He thought over the people of his
      acquaintance who were the most celebrated and in the best positions. He
      took finally, Marquis de la Tour-Noire and Colonel Bourdin, a great lord
      and a soldier who was very strong. Their names would carry in the
      journals. He perceived that he was thirsty and he drank, one after the
      other, three glasses of water; then he began to walk again. He felt
      himself full of energy. By showing himself hot-brained, resolute in all
      things, by exacting rigorous, dangerous conditions, and by claiming a
      serious duel, a very serious one, his adversary would doubtless withdraw
      and make some excuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took up the card which he had drawn from his pocket and thrown upon the
      table and re-read it as he had in the <i>café,</i> by a glance of the eye,
      and again in the cab, on returning home, by the light of a gas jet:
      &ldquo;George Lamil, 51 Moncey street.&rdquo; That was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He examined these assembled letters which appeared so mysterious to him,
      his senses all confused: George Lamil? Who was this man? What had he done?
      Why had he looked at that woman in such a way? Was it not revolting that a
      stranger, an unknown should come to trouble his life thus, at a blow,
      because he had been pleased to fix his insolent gaze upon a woman? And the
      Viscount repeated again, in a loud voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a brute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he remained motionless, standing, thinking, his look ever fixed upon
      the card. A certain anger against this piece of paper was awakened in him,
      a hateful anger which was mingled with a strange sentiment of malice. It
      was stupid, this whole story! He took a penknife which lay open at his
      hand, and pricked the card through the middle of-the printed name, as if
      he were using a poignard upon some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he must fight! Should he choose the sword or pistol, for he considered
      himself the insulted one. With the sword he risked less; but with the
      pistol, there was a chance of his adversary withdrawing. It is rarely that
      a duel with the sword is mortal, a reciprocal prudence hindering the
      combatants from keeping near enough to each other for the point to strike
      very deep; with the pistol he risked his life very seriously; but he could
      also meet the affair with all the honors of the situation and without
      arriving at a meeting. He said aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is necessary to be firm. He will be afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound of his own voice made him tremble and he began to look about
      him. He felt very nervous. He drank still another glass of water, then
      commenced to undress, preparatory to retiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was ready, he put out his light and closed his eyes. Then he
      thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have all day to-morrow to busy myself with my affairs. I must sleep
      first, in order to be calm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was very warm under the clothes, but he could not succeed in falling
      asleep. He turned and turned again, remained for five minutes upon his
      back, then placed himself upon his left side, then rolled over to the
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still thirsty. He got up and drank. Then a kind of disquiet seized
      him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be that I am afraid?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should his heart begin to beat so foolishly at each of the customary
      noises about his room?&mdash;when the clock was going to strike and the
      spring made that little grinding noise as it raised itself to make the
      turn? And he found it was necessary for him to open his mouth in order to
      breathe for some seconds following this start, so great was his feeling of
      oppression. He began to reason with himself upon the possibilities of the
      thing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I to fear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, certainly, he should not fear, since he was resolved to follow it out
      to the end and since he had fully made up his mind to fight without a
      qualm. But he felt himself so profoundly troubled that he asked himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be that I am afraid in spite of myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this doubt invaded him, this disquiet, this fear; if a force more
      powerful than his will, dominating, irresistible, should conquer him, what
      would happen to him? Yes, what would happen? Certainly he could walk upon
      the earth, if he wished to go there. But if he should tremble? And if he
      should lose consciousness? And he thought of his situation, of his
      reputation, of his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a singular desire took possession of him to get up and look at himself
      in the glass. He relighted his candle. When he perceived his face
      reflected in the polished glass, he scarcely knew himself, and it seemed
      to him that he had never seen himself before. His eyes appeared enormous;
      he was pale, certainly; he was pale, very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained standing there before the mirror. He put out his tongue as if
      to examine the state of his health, and suddenly this thought entered his
      brain after the fashion of a bullet:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After to-morrow at this time, I shall perhaps be dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And his heart began to beat furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After to-morrow at this time, I shall perhaps be dead. This person
      opposite me, this being I have so often seen in this glass, will be no
      more. How can it be! I am here, I see myself, I feel that I am alive, and
      in twenty-four hours I shall be stretched upon that bed, dead, my eyes
      closed, cold, inanimate, departed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned around to the bed and distinctly saw himself stretched on his
      back in the same clothes he had worn on going out. In his face were the
      lines of death, and a rigidity in the hands that would never stir again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a fear of his bed came over him, and in order to see it no more he
      passed into his smoking-room. Mechanically he took a cigar, lighted it,
      and began to walk about. He was cold. He went toward the bell to waken his
      valet; but he stopped with his hand on the cord:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man would perceive at once that I am afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not ring, but made a fire. His hands trembled a little from a
      nervous shiver when they came in contact with any object. His mind
      wandered; his thoughts from trouble became frightened, hasty, and
      sorrowful; an intoxication seemed to invade his mind as if he were drunk.
      And without ceasing he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I going to do? What is going to become of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His whole body was vibrating, traversed by a jerking and a trembling; he
      got up and approached the window, opening the curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day had dawned, a summer day. A rose-colored sky made the city rosy on
      roof and wall. A great fall of spread out light, like a caress from the
      rising sun, enveloped the waking world; and, with this light, a gay,
      rapid, brutal hope invaded the heart of the Viscount! He was a fool to
      allow himself to be thus cast down by fear, even before anything was
      decided, before his witnesses had seen those of this George Lamil, before
      he yet knew whether he were going to fight a duel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made his toilette, dressed himself, and walked out with firm step.
    </p>
    <p>
      He repeated constantly, in walking: &ldquo;It will be necessary for me to be
      energetic, very energetic. I must prove that I am not afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His witnesses, the Marquis and the Colonel, placed themselves at his
      disposal and, after having shaken hands with him energetically, discussed
      the conditions. The Colonel asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish it to be a serious duel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Viscount responded: &ldquo;Very serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis continued: &ldquo;Will you use a pistol?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We leave you free to regulate the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Viscount enunciated, in a dry, jerky voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty steps at the order, and on raising the arm instead of lowering it.
      Exchange of bullets until one is grievously wounded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel declared, in a satisfied tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are excellent conditions. You shoot well, all the chances are in
      your favor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They separated. The Viscount returned home to wait for them. His
      agitation, appeased, for a moment, grew now from minute to minute. He felt
      along his arms, his legs, and in his breast a kind of trembling, of
      continued vibration; he could not keep still, either sitting or standing.
      There was no longer an appearance of saliva in his mouth, and each instant
      he made a noisy movement with his tongue, as if to unglue it from the roof
      of his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wished to breakfast but he could not eat. Then the idea came to him of
      drinking to give himself courage and he brought out a small bottle of rum,
      which he swallowed in six little glasses, one after the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      A heat, like that of a burning fire, invaded him, followed almost
      immediately by a numbness of the soul. He thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have found the remedy. Now all goes well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at the end of an hour, he had emptied the bottle and his state of
      agitation became intolerable. He felt a foolish impulse to roll on the
      ground, to cry out and bite. Then night fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stroke of the bell gave him such a shock that he had not sufficient
      strength left to rise and receive his witnesses. He dared not even speak
      to them to say &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; to pronounce a single word, for fear that
      they would discover a change in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel announced:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is arranged according to the conditions that you have fixed upon.
      Your adversary claimed the privileges of the offended, but he soon yielded
      and accepted all. His witnesses are two military men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Viscount pronounced the word:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse us if we only come in and go out, for we have still a thousand
      things to occupy our attention. A good doctor will be necessary, since the
      combat is only to cease after a severe wound, and you know that bullets
      are no trifles. Then, a place must be found, in some proximity to a house,
      where we may carry the wounded, if necessary, etc., etc.; finally, we have
      but two or three hours for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Viscount, for the second time, articulated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it with you? Are you calm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very calm, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men then retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he again found himself alone, it seemed to him that he was mad. His
      domestic having lighted the lamps, he seated himself before his table to
      write some letters. After having traced, at the top of a page: &ldquo;This is my
      testament&mdash;&rdquo; he arose with a shake and put it away from him, feeling
      himself incapable of forming two ideas, or of sufficient resolution to
      decide what was to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he was going to fight a duel! There was no way to avoid it. How could
      he ever go through it? He wished to fight, it was his intention and firm
      resolution so to do; and yet, he felt, that in spite of all his effort of
      mind and all the tension of his will, he would not be able to preserve
      even the necessary force to go to the place of meeting. He tried to
      imagine the combat, his own attitude, and the position of his adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time, his teeth chattered in his mouth with a little hard
      noise. He tried to read, and took down the Chateauvillard code of dueling.
      Then he asked himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has my opponent frequently fought? Is he known? Is he classed? How am I
      to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He remembered Baron de Vaux&rsquo;s book upon experts with the pistol, and he
      ran through it from one end to the other. George Lamil was not mentioned.
      Nevertheless, if this man were not an expert, he would not so readily have
      accepted this dangerous weapon and these mortal conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened, in passing, a box of Gastinne Renettes which stood on a little
      stand, took out one of the pistols, held it in a position to fire, and
      raised his arm. But he trembled from head to foot and the gun worked upon
      all his senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he said: &ldquo;It is impossible. I cannot fight in this condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the end of the barrel, at that little black, deep hole that
      spits out death, he thought of the dishonor, of the whisperings in his
      circle, of the laughs in the drawing-rooms, of the scorn of the ladies, of
      the allusions of the journals, of all the insults that cowards would throw
      at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued to examine the weapon, and, raising the cock, he suddenly saw
      a priming glittering underneath like a little red flame. The pistol was
      loaded then, through a chance forgetfulness. And he found in this
      discovery a confused, inexplicable joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      If in the presence of the other man he did not have that calm, noble
      bearing that he should have, he would be lost forever. He would be
      spotted, branded with the sign of infamy, hunted from the world! And this
      calm, heroic bearing he would not have, he knew it, he felt it. However,
      he was brave, since he did wish to fight! He was brave, since.... The
      thought that budded never took form, even in his own mind; for, opening
      his mouth wide he brusquely thrust the barrel of his pistol into his
      throat, and pulled the trigger....
    </p>
    <p>
      When his valet, hearing the report, hastened to him, he found him dead
      upon his back. A jet of blood had splashed upon the white paper on the
      table and made a great red spot upon these four words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my testament.&rdquo;
     </p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
